## Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country

**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone XS** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

**Pros**

- **Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By **changing your App Store country**, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to **change your App Store country**.
- **Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. **Changing your App Store country** can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.
- **Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.

**Cons**

- **Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you've made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.
- **Offload Apps.**When you **change your App Store country**, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.
- **Family Sharing Issues.**If you're part of a Family Sharing group, **changing your App Store country** can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.

## Part 4: Turn off Find My iPhone using Recovery Mode

The recovery model of the Apple iPhone XS allows you to reset or restore your data. It also offers data cleaning and backing up of apps to keep your Apple iPhone XS updated and free of glitches. When your phone is lagging or not working properly, then you need to put it into Recovery Mode.

However, Recovery Mode can also be useful to turn off Find My iPhone on your device. Here are the steps that will guide you on how to turn off Find My iPhone on a broken phone using Recovery Mode.

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone XS to your computer via cable and wait for your computer to detect your device.

**Step 2:** As soon as your Apple iPhone XS is detected, open iTunes and force restart your phone to activate the Recovery Mode. Activating this mode is different for different models of iPhone.

- For iPhone 8 and the later: Press the Volume Down button and release is immediately. Then press the Volume Up button and release it immediately again. After that, press and hold the Power Button until you see the Apple logo.
- For iPhone 7 and 7+: Press the Power Button and Volume Down button at the same time and hold them until the Apple logo appears on your screen.
- For iPhone 6s, and Previous Models: Press and hold the Home Button and Power button concurrently until your Apple iPhone XS shows the Apple logo.

Once your Apple iPhone XS shows the Apple logo, it means the Recovery Mode is activated.
