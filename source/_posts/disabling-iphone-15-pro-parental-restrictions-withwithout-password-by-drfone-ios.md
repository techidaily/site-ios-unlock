## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.
