### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 8 Plus with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 8 Plus, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 8 Plus was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 8 Plus in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 8 Plus using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 8 Plus itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
