## Part II: FAQs

Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.

### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

![touch id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-5.jpg)

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

So, if you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max passcode and are looking for how to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max without passcode, use this guide to pick one of the three easy ways to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max in case of forgotten passcode.
