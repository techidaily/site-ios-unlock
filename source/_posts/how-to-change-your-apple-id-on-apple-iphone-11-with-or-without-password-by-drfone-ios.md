## Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID

Your iOS devices contain most of your digital data. That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.

If you feel the existing Apple ID isn't secure enough, it's a good idea to **change your Apple ID on your iPad** or other devices. Aside from this, there are a few scenarios where you might find yourself needing to change your details:

You No Longer Use the Email Address or Phone Number Associated With Your Apple ID

Life moves fast, and sometimes contact info changes. If the email or phone number linked to your Apple ID becomes outdated, it's a good idea to update it. That way, you won't miss out on vital notifications or have trouble recovering your account if needed.

You Want To Simplify Your Online Life

If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.

You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country

Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.

![apple id account information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-02.jpg)

## How To Remove Flashlight From Apple iPhone 11 Lock Screen

Ever wonder why the flashlight shows up on your Apple iPhone 11 lock screen? Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you're holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.

While you can't remove it, figuring out **how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens** is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device's battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 11's lock screen and make it work better for you.

![iphone lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?

You can't remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn't currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.

Find out the steps below.

Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake

Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 11 screen with a simple tap. It's handy, but there's a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don't want any unexpected brightness.

Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to **remove the flashlight from lock screens**. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won't light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.

Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** or **General** > **Accessibility** on your Apple iPhone 11 device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off **Tap to Wake**.

![iphone turn off tap to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake

With "Raise to Wake" enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 11. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you'll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.

Here is **how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens** when not needed:

- **Step 1:** Head to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off the **Raise to Wake** option.

![iphone turn off raise to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center

The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and navigate to **Control Center**.
- **Step 2:** Tap on **Customize Controls**, then find the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 3:** Tap the red minus (**\-**) sign next to the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Remove** to confirm deleting the **Flashlight** icon from the **Control Center**.

![remove flashlight from iphone control center](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut

Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 11 lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone's back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.

Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won't accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here's how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Touch** > **Back Tap**.
- **Step 2:** Select the **Double Tap** or **Triple Tap** option you're using for the flashlight shortcut.
- **Step 3:** Choose **None** instead of the currently assigned action, which might be ****Flashlight****.

![setup iphone back tap to none](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?

Now, let's address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 11. Even if you've applied Part 1's solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you'll learn **how to turn the light off on iPhone** devices.

Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center

You can't remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover **how to turn off the flashlight** on your Apple iPhone 11: Here's how to do it.

- **Step 1:** Find the flashlight icon in the **Control Center**. It's usually located in the bottom left corner.
- **Step 2:** Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.

![turn off flashlight from control center](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg)

This method is fast and convenient, especially if you've kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.

Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight

To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven't customized the Control Center. Here's **how to turn off the flashlight** with Siri on your Apple iPhone 11:

- **Step 1:** Say **"Hey Siri"** or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Give the commands saying, **"Turn off the flashlight."**
- **Step 3:** Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You'll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.

![use siri to turn off flashlight](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg)
