**Instructions:** On your Apple iPhone 6s's home screen, navigate to the Outlook mail app. Long-press the Outlook app icon and choose "Remove App" from the pop-up menu. Then, tap "Delete App" and follow it by pressing "Delete" to uninstall the app. Afterward, access the App Store and download the Microsoft Outlook app again.

### Fix 9. Try Other Alternatives to Outlook

Exploring alternative mail applications may offer a viable workaround. This is especially true if the **iPhone asking for the Outlook password** proves resistant to previous solutions. Consider using other email platforms such as Apple Mail, [<u>Gmail</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-gmail-phone-verification.html), and Yahoo Mail.

**Instructions.** On your Apple iPhone 6s, access "Mail" settings through the Settings application. Now, scroll down to find and tap the "Privacy Protection" option in the "Messages" section.
