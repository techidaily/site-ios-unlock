However, sometimes you’re genuinely trying to enter the correct password, but your device won’t accept it. This isn't common, but there are quite a few reasons why iPhone is saying your passcode is wrong.

Sometimes the problem is trivial, like you may have entered the wrong keys in a hurry, due to which it won't accept your passcode. In other cases, face recognition may not recognize your face if you're wearing any mask.

However, occasionally the problem is technical. Sometimes, your Apple iPhone 8 may be corrupted. This can cause trouble for your device to detect the security file where your passcode is stored. Other times, the operating system may not be installed properly after updating to the new version of iOS.
