Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 13 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 13 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 13 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 13/Apple iPhone 13 mini/Apple iPhone 13 Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 13 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 13 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 13 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 13 range builds on the Apple iPhone 13 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 13 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 13 lineup. the Apple iPhone 13 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 13 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 13 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 13 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 13 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 13 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 13 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 13 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 13 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 13. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 13 and unlocking it.
