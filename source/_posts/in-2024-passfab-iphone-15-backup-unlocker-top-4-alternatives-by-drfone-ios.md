A few methods allow you to guess or brute-force your way into the password. Still, the most reliable method to unlock your backup is to use a professional tool such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, Passfab iPhone Backup Unlocker, or other iPhone backup unlockers. This group of software employs a sophisticated algorithm to figure out your password for you, and it has a high percentage of success.

### Fix 2. Change the Password to Your Outlook Mail

- **Step 1.** Open your preferred web browser and go to the Outlook login page. Sign in to your Outlook account, locate, and click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner. There, click "My Profile," and on the next screen, tap "Change Password" near the upper right corner.

![access my profile outlook web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-4.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Upon reaching the verification page, provide your password and tap the "Sign In" button. Afterward, you will be asked for other verification methods. Upon verifying, the "Change your password" window will appear. Here, you will need to enter your "Current password," "New password," and re-enter it to proceed.

### Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection

[<u>Network inconsistencies</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html) can often disrupt the authentication process. This can be the leading cause behind persistent password prompts. To ensure a stable connection, ensure that you are connected to a reliable and stable Wi-Fi network. You can also try toggling the Wi-Fi and mobile data switches on and off.

Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.

### Fix 4. Using the Mail Toggle as a Remedy

A strategic approach to resolving authentication issues involves using the Mail toggle. You can use it to disable and re-enable the email services. This action essentially resets the Outlook app's connection and can be performed as follows:

- **Step 1.** Within your Apple iPhone 15's "Settings" app, scroll down and tap "Mail." On the following screen, press "Accounts" and choose the "Outlook" account.

![proceed with outlook account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-7.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Here, you will find the toggle switch for "Mail." Now, turn off the email service and wait for a few moments. Toggle the switch back on to re-enable the email service.
