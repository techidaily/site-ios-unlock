### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.

You only need to wait for some time as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don't interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

Once the process is completed, your Apple iPhone 6 Plus will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.

This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your Apple iPhone 6 Plus passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.


## How Can I Turn On/Off the Passcode on My iPhone?

If you want to turn the Passcode ON your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, then follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Go to 'Settings' and select 'Touch ID & Passcode' (if you're using an iPhone with Touch ID). If you're using an iPhone without a Touch ID, select 'Passcode.'

**Step 2:** Enter your current Passcode when prompted.

**Step 3:** Scroll down and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'ON' position.

**Step 4:** Enter a new 6-digit passcode when prompted. Then, please enter it again to confirm.

That's it! Your Passcode is now turned ON, and your device is more secure than ever.

To shut down the Passcode on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, follow the steps above and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'OFF' position.
