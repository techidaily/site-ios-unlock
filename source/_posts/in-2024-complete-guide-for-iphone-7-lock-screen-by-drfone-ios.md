iPhone users can unlock the phone by using iTunes. Following are its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. Most iPhones are synced with iTunes, which benefits the user as it restores the latest backup on iPhone after removing the screen lock.
2. iTunes is easy to understand and simple to use.

**Cons:**

1. The biggest drawback people face with iTunes is that the data can be erased if no latest backup is taken.
2. Another factor that causes the problem is iTunes' slow functionality, as it consumes a lot of time to complete a process.

### 3\. Using iCloud

Another known platform for iPhone users is iCloud, which allows users to unlock the screen without using the passcode. Let us share its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. The biggest benefit of using iCloud is that the user doesn't have to connect the Apple iPhone 7 with the system. Just login is required for iCloud.
2. Another factor is that no technical skills are needed to use iCloud. The user needs access to their iCloud account.

**Cons:**

1. User requires a strong and stable internet connection to log in to iCloud and in case internet is not available, they cannot unlock the screen.
2. Another disadvantage is that if 'Find my iPhone' is not enabled on the Apple iPhone 7 device, then the user cannot unlock the screen through iCloud.
