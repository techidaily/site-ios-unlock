## Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone X passcode in Recovery Mode?

If none of the above-mentioned solutions would work, then you can always choose to put your Apple iPhone X in recovery mode and restore it. After when your Apple iPhone X would be restored, you can access it without any lock. It can be done by following these steps:

1\. Firstly, you need to put your device in recovery mode. Beforehand, you need to make sure that your device is turned off. If not, press the Power button and slide the screen to turn your Apple iPhone X off.

2\. Now, launch iTunes on your Mac or Windows system. Afterward, press and hold the Home button on your Apple iPhone X. While holding the Home button, connect it to your system.

3\. You will get an iTunes symbol on the screen. In no time, iTunes will also detect your device.

4\. As iTunes will detect your device in recovery mode, it will display a prompt similar to this.

5\. Simply agree to it and let iTunes restore your device.

Once your device has been restored, you can access it without any screen lock.

## Part 4: About data loss after unlocking Apple iPhone X passcode

As you can see, in all the above-mentioned solutions, your Apple iPhone X data would be lost while unlocking its passcode. This is because, as of now, there is no way to unlock an iPhone without restoring it. Needless to say, while restoring a device, its data is automatically lost. Since Apple is quite concerned about the security of the Apple iPhone X and the sensitivity of its data, it doesn’t let users unlock the Apple iPhone X device without losing their data.

Even though lots of users have complained about this issue, Apple hasn’t come up with a solution yet. The best way to avoid this scenario is by taking a regular backup of your data. You can either backup your data on iCloud, via iTunes, or by using any third-party tool as well. In this way, you won’t be able to lose your important files while unlocking your device’s passcode.

## Conclusion

Now when you know how to unlock Apple iPhone X passcode without iTunes, you can easily access your device. Ideally, you can simply take the assistance of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) to unlock your device. It can also be used to resolve any other problem related to your Apple iPhone X/iPad as well. Feel free to give it a try and let us know if you face any problems while using it.
