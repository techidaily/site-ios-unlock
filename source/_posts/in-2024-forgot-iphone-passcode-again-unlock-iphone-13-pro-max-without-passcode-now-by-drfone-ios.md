## Part II: FAQs

Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.

### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

![touch id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-8-without-passcode-5.jpg)

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

Before unlocking iPhone through the Apple Watch, some requirements are necessary for security reasons. Read the following requirements to proceed further:

- First, you would need an Apple Watch that must be functioning on WatchOS 7.4 or later.
- The passcode on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max must be enabled from the settings. If you have not enabled the passcode on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, you can do it by navigating to the "Settings" and tapping on "Passcode." From there, enable the passcode by turning it on.
- You should be wearing the Apple Watch on your wrist, and it must be unlocked.
- Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max should be upgraded to iOS 14.5 or above.
- The wrist detection on your phone should be activated.

To enable the feature of unlocking the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max with an Apple Watch, the steps are:

**Step** **1:** Head to the " Settings " app and choose "Face ID & Passcode." Give your passcode for authenticity and proceed further.

After enabling this feature, you can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max with a mask on through your Apple Watch. You need to grab your phone and hold it the same way you would in a normal Face ID scan. The phone will be unlocked, and you will feel a slight vibration on the wrist. Also, a notification will pop up on your watch, indicating that your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max has been unlocked.
