## Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 6s Plus

For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.

Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus 13/12/11 and set it again if you have put on some 'COVID weight' owing to working from home.

Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 6s Plus 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.
