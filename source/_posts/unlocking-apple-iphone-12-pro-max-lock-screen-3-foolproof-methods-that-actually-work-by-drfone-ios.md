The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

**Step 4:** Enter a new 6-digit passcode when prompted. Then, please enter it again to confirm.

That's it! Your Passcode is now turned ON, and your device is more secure than ever.

To shut down the Passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, follow the steps above and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'OFF' position.

### The Bottom Line

As you see in the article, there are some ways to reset your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max passcode. However, if you're looking for an easy and effective solution, we recommend using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock. It is a professional tool that can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max without a passcode. Plus, it doesn't cause any damage to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device, which is always a good thing.

If you're not interested in using a third-party tool, you can try one of the methods mentioned above. But keep in mind that these methods may only work on some iPhones. So, if you need help deciding which way to use it, we recommend going with Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock.
