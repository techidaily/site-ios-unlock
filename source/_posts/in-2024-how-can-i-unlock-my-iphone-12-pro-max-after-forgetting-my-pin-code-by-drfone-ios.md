That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
