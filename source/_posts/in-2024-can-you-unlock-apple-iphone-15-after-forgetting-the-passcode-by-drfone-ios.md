### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 15 in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 15 device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 15, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 15 to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 15 transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 15 to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 15.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 15 to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 15 and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

After several wrong attempts, an "Erase iPhone" choice will appear on the screen's lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 15 and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.

If the Apple iPhone 15 device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 15 cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 15.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

If you don’t want to erase your device’s data while resolving this issue, you can use Siri. You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone 15 by implementing the following steps:

**Step 1.** To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.

**Step 2.** On the world clock interface, add another clock.

**Step 3.** The interface will ask you to search for a location of your choice. Type anything on the search tab and select it to get various options. Tap on the “Select all” text.

**Step 4.** A few added options will be displayed. Tap on “Share” to proceed.

**Step 5.** Out of all the options to share this text, select the Message app.

**Step 6.** A new interface will be opened from where you can draft a new message. Type anything in the “To” field and tap "return" from a keyboard.

**Step 7.** Then the text will be highlighted. Tap on the add icon.

![add contact](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492469564.jpg "add contact")

**Step 8.** This will open another interface to add a new contact. From here, tap on the “Create new contact” option.

**Step 9.** Instead of adding a contact, tap on the photo icon and select the “Choose Photo” option.

![choose photo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492748614.jpg "choose photo")

**Step 10.** This will open the photo library on your phone. Visit an album or wait for a while.

**Step 11.** Now, press the home button. If nothing goes wrong, then you will enter the Home screen on your phone.
