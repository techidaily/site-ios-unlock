**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 6s** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

- **Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. **Changing your App Store country** can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience.
