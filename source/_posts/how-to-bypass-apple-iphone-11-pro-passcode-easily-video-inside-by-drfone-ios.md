## Part 5: How to Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Using Siri

If you do not have any potential source for unlocking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, you can consider using Siri for this purpose. Here are the steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro lock screen using Siri.

**Step 1:** You need to activate Siri on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Keep holding the Home button or Side button according to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro model for activating it. When activated, speak “What time is it” to it.

**Step 2:** Siri will display the time with a clock icon on the front. Click on the icon to open the associated interface. Click on the “+” icon and proceed to the next screen. You will find a search box on the next screen. Type random characters and hold the tab until it shows the option of “Select All.”

**Step 3:** You will find the option of the “Share” button soon. A pop-up opens after tapping on the button, which shows different options that can be accessed. Click on “Messages” to move to the next screen.

**Step 4:** Fill out the “To” box with some characters and click on “Return” on your keyboard. You need to press the Home button or swipe up according to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro model. The home page of your Apple iPhone 11 Pro will be accessed successfully.

**Pros**

- The data across your Apple iPhone 11 Pro will not get erased with this process.
- You do not need to access any other third-party tool for unlocking your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

**Cons**

- If you have a version of iOS except **3.2 and 10.3.3**, you cannot use this method.
- This method is not applicable if Siri is not activated across your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

## Part 6: FAQs about iPhone Screen Lock

1. **How many counts do I have to unlock my iPhone?**

You have around ten entries to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, after which the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device will be completely locked.

After the 10<sup>th</sup> wrong entry, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device gets locked out and allows you to connect to iTunes.

2. **Is it possible to reset the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode with an Apple ID?**

No, you cannot reset the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode using Apple ID. Both are different security measures and cannot reset one using another.

4. **Can Apple reset a forgotten iPhone passcode?**

No, Apple cannot reset the forgotten iPhone passcode. However, they will help you with the steps to erase, reset, and recover the phone. You must prove yourself to be the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device owner, so keep the purchase receipt with you.
