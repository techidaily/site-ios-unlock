## How to Remove and Reset Face ID on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/)

Did you go wrong when you set the Face ID the first time? Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max? And now, you want to disable the Face ID. Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn **how to remove Face ID** on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.

## Part I: What is Face ID?

![face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

If the new Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 14, and now the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

![an apple aard in wallet app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg)

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

## Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.

Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13/12/11 and set it again if you have put on some 'COVID weight' owing to working from home.

Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode.

Step 2: Scroll and tap the option "Reset Face ID" to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13/12/11.

![wa stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg)

## Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.

Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

![setting up face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg)

Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.

Step 5: When done, tap Done.

In case you are getting the following error:

![face id error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg)

There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max 13/12/11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.

If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

## Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID & Passcode?

Leveraging the advanced security capabilities of Face ID or Passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max X or later models effectively fortifies app access. By using facial recognition or passcodes, you can put in place an extra layer of protection. It can be done for specific apps, safeguarding your sensitive data from unauthorized access. Now, let's proceed with the detailed steps to lock apps using Face ID or Passcode on your iOS device:

**Step 1.** After opening the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, scroll down to access "Face ID & Passcode." Here, you will be required to provide the passcode of your device.

**Step 2.** After providing the passcode, select "Other Apps" and check the apps that have Face ID enabled. Remember, you're unable to manually include apps in the list. Only those apps that have sought access to the feature will appear here automatically.

If you are unable to lock the targeted app directly with Face ID, there is no need to worry. There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won't directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.

**Step 1.** On your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, launch the Shortcuts app and select the "Automation" tab from the bottom toolbar. There, tap "New Automation" and use the search bar to look for and select "App."

**Step 4.** Finally, tap "Done" to finalize the shortcut. Now, upon accessing the targeted app, the shortcut will activate in the background, causing your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to be locked. You can then use the Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to unlock it.
