## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover **how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account**, here are three things you should consider:

- **Complexity**

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

- **Uniqueness**

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password. Read on to get to the heart of the matter – **how to change the password on Apple ID**. Doing it is easy; you can do it on your Apple iPhone 6, iPad, Mac, or the web.

- **Step 3:** iTunes will prompt you to either restore or update your Apple iPhone 6. Choose the **Restore iPhone** option to reset your device to its factory settings. If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 6 exits recovery mode, you'll need to repeat the steps.

### Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone

After **many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 6**，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.

- **Step 2:** Select **All Devices**, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu. Once you've chosen the Apple iPhone 6 device, click the **Erase iPhone** icon in the lower-right corner. Although the action deletes the data on the phone, you can retrieve it from your iCloud backup once the Apple iPhone 6 device is operational again.

### Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store

If all methods fail or you don't have access to Dr.Fone, consider contacting Apple Support. You can also try visiting an Apple Store. Apple experts will guide you through the appropriate steps based on your unique situation.

## Conclusion

If you are wondering **how many passcode attempts on iPhone** will lock your device and not sure how to fix this issue, here is the way to go. Methods like iTunes, Recovery Mode, iCloud, or seeking Apple Support all offer potential solutions.

Consider using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) for a secure and data-preserving unlock. It safeguards your data even if you forget your passcode.
