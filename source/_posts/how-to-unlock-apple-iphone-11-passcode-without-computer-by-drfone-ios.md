If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 11.**

After you connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the "Your iPhone name" and ask you to restore it. In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn't run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Keep waiting until the restoration completes. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 11 and follow the on-screen directions. That will allow you to set up and utilize your device.

**Step 3. Confirm Your Apple iPhone 11 Model**

After opening the recovery mode, you can see your Device Model and iOS version. You must select the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. After doing so, click download to download the suitable firmware package for your phone model.

## Part 2: FAQs

### How can I change my PIN on my iPhone?

- Open your Settings app and peer down until you see the passcode menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Touch ID and Passcode." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Passcode."
