With iOS 15.2, Apple introduced the Erase iPhone feature, aiding users in resetting devices with forgotten passcodes. The functionality applies to iPhones connected to the network with a broken Home button. Compatible devices include iPhone 6 series, iPhone SE series, and newer models. However, it comes at the cost of erasing all content and data on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Put your Apple iPhone 12 Pro in the recovery mode and connect it to the computer. Launch Finder or iTunes for Windows or Mac Mojave users.
