## Part 2: How to Turn Off Passcode or Face ID on My Device?

Face ID can be a helpful method for unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro - by simply looking at your phone. However, a few clients might worry that it's not as secure as utilizing a PIN to open your phone. If that is the best case for you, you can follow this manual to disable Face ID and depend on a passcode.

Here's the step-by-step guide to the most effective method to switch off Face ID on the iPhone:

### 1\. Open the Settings application

First, tap on your Settings app to open it. That is the one on the home screen with a symbol like the mechanical gear.

### 2\. Tap on Face ID and Passcode

On the Settings menu, tap on the Face ID and Passcode menu.

![passcode menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-6.jpg)

### 3\. Enter your passcode

At this stage, you'll be approached to enter your passcode, so do this to get to the Face ID and Passcode menu.

### 4\. Switch off Face ID

You'll have the option to turn off the switch for Face ID across different activities, including the phone unlock.

![turn off passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-7.jpg)

## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

### The Bottom Line

That's all about our take on **how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.** We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand. However, we strongly suggest Dr.Fone if you still face issues with our solutions. Even if the above methods fail, Dr.Fone will ensure you unlock your phone.
