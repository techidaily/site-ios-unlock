## Part 1. How Many Times Until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus Is Permanently Disabled?

Unlocking an iPhone involves a series of attempts, each with distinct consequences. Here's a breakdown of **how many failed passcode attempts on an iPhone** you can do before it locks you out:

**First 5 Attempts**

- No significant consequences.
- Users have the flexibility to enter their passcode without any penalties.

**6th Attempt**

- iPhone is disabled for 1 minute.
- An iPhone is Disabled message appears on the screen.

![iphone is disabled 1 minute](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-02.jpg)

**7th Attempt**

- Disabled for 5 minutes.
- The same on-screen message persists, but the Apple iPhone 15 Plus enforces a longer wait time.

**8th Attempt**

- Disabled for 15 minutes.
- Users must wait before attempting again. The escalating time delay discourages brute-force attacks.

**9th Attempt**

- Disabled for 60 minutes.
- A considerable waiting period is imposed. It increases the frustration for unauthorized users attempting to gain access.

![iphone is disabled 1 hour](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-03.jpg)

**10th Attempt**

- iPhone is disabled.

![iphone is disabled connect to itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-04.jpg)

Two things can happen on the tenth failed attempt to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. If you have **Erase Data** enabled, your phone's data gets wiped. If it's disabled, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is permanently locked, requiring a connection to iTunes for restoration. It's crucial to [<u>back up your data on iCloud</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html) or locally to avoid permanent loss.

## Part 2. What Are the Consequences After Consecutive Failed Attempts?

When you exceed ten unsuccessful passcode entries, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device takes stringent actions to protect sensitive data. It can initiate a data wipe or lock the iPhone, needing a connection to iTunes for restoration. After a series of failed attempts, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus can activate a security measure often referred to as a "self-destruct" mode.

To turn this mode on or off, follow these steps:

### How To Enable Erase Data Mode

Safeguard your personal information with these simple steps to remotely wipe your device in case of loss or theft.

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode** or **Touch ID & Passcode**, depending on your device. Enter your current passcode.

![iphone erase data feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-05.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Scroll down and find the Erase Data option. Toggle the button to activate the feature.

### How To Disable Erase Data Mode

Here are the steps to disable Erase Data Mode on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, ensuring controlled access to your device.

- **Step 1**: Follow the same steps to access the **Erase Data** toggle. Next, disable the toggle to turn off this feature.
- **Step 2**: Confirm your choice, ensuring the "self-destruct" mode is deactivated to prevent accidental data loss.

## Part 3. Top 5 Methods To Unlock an iPhone After Too Many Attempts

### Method 2: Using iTunes To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

An alternative method to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus when locked or disabled involves using iTunes. Note that if your iTunes is not synchronized with the iPhone, you risk losing your existing data. Here's how:
