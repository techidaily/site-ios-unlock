The competition in the market between Android and iOS has been increased ever since the features are increasing. People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.

Looking more into the Apple iPhone 6 Plus world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 6 Plus . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.

## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 6 Plus  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 6 Plus  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

## Part 5. What To Do When iCloud Activation Lock Active?

Although IMEI Unlocking turns out to be quite an exceptional service, it generally is not the only thing that becomes a barrier for iPhone users. The iCloud Activation binds an Apple device to a user's Apple ID, making itself a great security measure. It presents a unique circumstance where services such as **doctorSIM legit** are inapplicable. [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) specializes in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock.

It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions.

### Steps To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock via Wondershare Dr.Fone

Dr.Fone is intended for users locked out of their devices. Given below are the steps you need to follow when using Dr.Fone to bypass iCloud Activation Lock:

#### 1\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1

- **Step 1. Installation and iCloud Activation Lock Removal**

Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the "Toolbox" tab, navigate to "Screen Unlock" and select "iOS."

- **Step 2. Device Identification and Unlock Initiation**

Now, decide whether your device is GSM or CDMA, as it is an important aspect. Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device won't affect the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device. However, running this process on a CDMA device will result in a loss of cellular activities. Click "Unlock Now" to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you'll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click "Got It!" after agreeing with all the mentioned points.

![start to unlock device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-4.png)

- **Step 3. Jailbreaking and Activation Lock Bypass**

After this, if your iDevice isn't jailbroken, you will be required to jailbreak your device. For that, you can follow the step-by-step textual instructions or watch a video. Once the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is jailbroken, the process will commence automatically to bypass the Activation Lock. A completion message will pop up on the window when the process finishes. Afterward, tap the “Done” button to finalize the process successfully.

![icloud activation lock successfully removed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-9.png)

On accessing the “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” page, a notification will display on the screen, alerting the user about the ongoing process. Carefully review all the information provided and select the "I have read and agree to the agreement" option. Proceed by tapping on the "Got It!" choice.

![unlock required iphone device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-11.png)

- **Step 2. DFU Mode Initiation and Device Unlock**

Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the [DFU Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/dfu-mode/tools-for-iphone-to-enter-dfu-mode.html) for your iOS device. Once in the particular mode, the program will send an initial command to the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device, prompting it to restart.

Once finished, a completion message will appear on the screen. Click “Done” to finalize the removal of the iCloud Activation Lock.
