An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone 8 may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone 8 keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

Upholding a stable internet connection is necessary for effortless communication. An unreliable or unstable network can disrupt the synchronization process in Outlook.
