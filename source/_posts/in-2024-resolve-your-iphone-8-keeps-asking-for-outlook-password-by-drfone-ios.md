## Part 1: Why You Need to "Unlock Apple iPhone 8 to Use Accessories"?

The command comes from Apple’s significant privacy safeguard **“USB Restricted Mode”**. It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only. Simply put, when your Apple iPhone 8 is locked for more than an hour, it needs to be unlocked to allow the connection of USB accessories. Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 8 screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers. To combat hackers including GrayKey and protect iOS users' data security, the USB Restricted Mode feature arrived with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018 and be improved in iOS12.

## **Part 1: Common Causes for Random Apple ID Verification Pop Up**

The **random Apple ID verification pop-up** can be caused by a range of factors, from simple settings misconfigurations to more complex account-related issues. So it's important to identify the root cause to find the appropriate solution that addresses the underlying issue.

Take a closer look at these common reasons why your Apple iPhone 8 may be **randomly asking for your Apple ID password**:

- **iOS Software Update****：**

One of the most frequent causes of the Apple ID password prompts is when your Apple iPhone 8 has undergone a software update. The update may require you to re-verify your Apple ID credentials to ensure security and privacy.

- **iCloud Account Settings****：**

If the settings are not in sync with your Apple ID credentials or if there are inconsistencies, it can trigger repeated password prompts.

- **App Store/iTunes Purchase****：**

If there was an issue when you purchased or downloaded something, your Apple iPhone 8 might prompt you to verify your Apple ID to complete the purchase.

- **iCloud Keychain****：**

The iCloud Keychain is a feature that stores your passwords and other sensitive information across your Apple devices. If there are inconsistencies or conflicts with the iCloud Keychain data, it may prompt you to verify your Apple ID password.

- **Network Connectivity****：**

Sometimes, network connectivity issues can cause the Apple ID password prompts to appear repeatedly. If your Apple iPhone 8 is struggling to establish a stable internet connection, it may trigger verification prompts.

These are some of the common causes that can trigger the **random Apple ID verification pop-up** on your Apple iPhone 8. Now, we'll delve into the solutions to help you resolve this matter.
