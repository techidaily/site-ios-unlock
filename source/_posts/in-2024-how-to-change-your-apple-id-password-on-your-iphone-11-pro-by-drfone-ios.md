## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover **how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account**, here are three things you should consider:

- **Complexity**

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

- **Uniqueness**

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

## 3 Simple Methods to Factory Reset Locked iPhone

## FAQs

### 1\. Can a Factory Reset Bypass the Lock screen Passcode on iPhone?

Yes. A factory reset will bypass the lock screen passcode on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and allow you to access it without a passcode. However, all your data will disappear, so make sure you have a backup.

### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone 11 Pro set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:

![hard reset iphone 6 while locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/factory-reset-locked-iphone-without-itunes-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the " Sleep/Wake " button and the " Home " button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.

**Step 2:** After 10 seconds have passed, release the " Sleep/Wake " button but keep holding the " Home " button.

**Step 3:** Keep holding the " Home " button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

**Step 4:** Here, you will be in recovery mode, and now you can reset your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

Your device will now be reset, and you will have a phone like a new one.

### 5\. How can I get into a locked iPhone?

If you have lost the passcode of your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, then you can use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool to factory reset your device. To do this, you need to proceed with the steps given above. They are easy to follow and will help you reset your device without risk.

### The Bottom Line

These are some of the most effective methods that can help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes. You can use any of these methods to reset your device and get rid of the lock screen.
