![unlock-iPhone-to-use-accessories](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/unlock-new/unlock-usb/unlock-iPhone-to-use-accessories.png)

You may have had the experience of connecting your Apple iPhone 7 to a computer with USB accessories. Usually, "**Unlock Apple iPhone 7 to use accessories**" will appear on the screen.

Here come the most effective methods for you!

## Part 1: Why You Need to "Unlock Apple iPhone 7 to Use Accessories"?

The command comes from Apple’s significant privacy safeguard **“USB Restricted Mode”**. It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only. Simply put, when your Apple iPhone 7 is locked for more than an hour, it needs to be unlocked to allow the connection of USB accessories. Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 7 screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers. To combat hackers including GrayKey and protect iOS users' data security, the USB Restricted Mode feature arrived with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018 and be improved in iOS12.

## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone 7

Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 7 device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 7 device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 7 device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 7 device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 7 device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone 7 device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 7 device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 7 Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone 7 locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 7 device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 7 device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 7 device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 7:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 7 device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 7:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

![select find my feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 7 from "All Devices." Now choose "Erase iPhone" from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 7 device and remove the Activation Lock.

![tap on erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg)

### Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 7 Locked to Owner

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 7 device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 7 to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.

The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 7 device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone 7 Activation Lock:

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 7 is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 7 Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.
- ****Step 2:**** Select "More Wi-Fi Settings" using the "i" symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose "Configure DNS" and follow it by selecting the "Manual" option.
- ****Step 3:**** Afterward, press "Add Server," located under "DNS Servers." Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:

- For users in the United States/North America: 104.154.51.7
- For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90
- For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58
- For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60

![use the dns method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg)

- ****Step 4:**** Save the changes by selecting "Save." Use the back arrow button to go back and choose "Ask to Join Networks." Enter the network password and tap "Join." Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone 7 attempts to activate. Afterward, continue to set up your Apple iPhone 7.

### Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service

What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn't working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone 7. All you need to provide them is your Apple iPhone 7 IMEI number. The process is done remotely and takes 24 to 48 hours to complete.

Ensure your device IMEI is not blacklisted before sending it for the unlocking process. Described below are steps to use [<u>DirectUnlocks</u>](https://directunlocks.com/en_us/icloud-unlock), an iCloud Activation removal service:

## What Can I Do to Contact Its Owner?

Once the found iPhone is successfully unlocked, you can contact its owner in many ways.

Following are some of them that work.

### Contact the owner with the phone number in lost mode

Many iPhone owners habitually put their phone numbers in lost mode. So, you can check if any phone number is available in the lost mode. If a phone number is available, you can contact the owner and return the Apple iPhone 7 to them.

The rightful owner of the Apple iPhone 7 activates lost mode. You can see the lost mode on the notification panel, where a message will show that the phone is lost. The owner can also remotely lock the phone using this mode.

### Check medical ID in an emergency call

There is a feature in the Apple iPhone 7 known as medical ID. This feature can help you contact the owner of the found iPhone if they are unavailable.

To do this, go to the emergency call screen and tap on the Medical ID option. Here, you can find out the name and phone number of the owner. So, you can use this information to contact the owner and return the iPhone.

### Take photos to communicate with the owner via iCloud

This is a great way to contact the owner of a lost iPhone. You can use this method if you cannot find the owner's phone number in the lost mode or medical ID.

To do this, go to Settings -> iCloud -> Photos and turn on the iCloud Photo Library. Now, take some pictures with the found iPhone, and they will be automatically uploaded to iCloud.

Most people who have lost their iPhones often check their iCloud, and once they find out that someone is taking pictures and uploading them to their iCloud, they will try to communicate with you.

And that's how you can also communicate with them and ask for contact details so that you can return their phone and be a good citizen.

### The Bottom Line

So, that's how you can unlock a found iPhone and contact its owner. I hope this article will help you find the lost iPhone owner and return it to them.

All the methods mentioned above have a high success ratio, but the last ultimate method is better than all because it will unlock the Apple iPhone 7 within minutes.

Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is one of the most effective ways can help you to unlock a found iPhone. This method has been tested, and it will surely work for you. So, if you have an iPhone that is locked or disabled, you can use this method to unlock it without any problem.
