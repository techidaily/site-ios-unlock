## Part 2: How to bypass the Apple iPhone SE passcode with Siri? (iOS 8.0 – iOS 10.1)

If you are an avid user of Apple products, then the chances are that you must have already heard of this Apple iPhone SE hack. If you are running a device on iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1, then you can take the assistance of Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone SE lock.
