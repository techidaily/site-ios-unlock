So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 14 with a new passcode, right?

Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we'll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.

### 1\. Use Find My iPhone

![with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg)
