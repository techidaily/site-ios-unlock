You may have had the experience of connecting your Apple iPhone XS to a computer with USB accessories. Usually, "**Unlock Apple iPhone XS to use accessories**" will appear on the screen. In most cases, enter the passcode to unlock the phone, and you can then proceed with data transfer and management. What to do if you forget your screen lock passcode? Here come the most effective methods for you!

## Part 1: Why You Need to "Unlock Apple iPhone XS to Use Accessories"?

The command comes from Apple’s significant privacy safeguard **“USB Restricted Mode”**. It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only. Simply put, when your Apple iPhone XS is locked for more than an hour, it needs to be unlocked to allow the connection of USB accessories. Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone XS screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers. To combat hackers including GrayKey and protect iOS users' data security, the USB Restricted Mode feature arrived with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018 and be improved in iOS12.

## Part 2: How to Disable USB Restricted Mode?

If you find this warning annoying or your Apple iPhone XS not charging when using USB accessories, disabling USB Restricted Mode is an optional solution. However, you have to remember the unlock passcode. All the steps will be presented to you next.

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings** on your Apple iPhone XS.
- **Step 2:** Click on **Face ID & Passcode** (or **Touch ID & Passcode**), and then input your screen passcode.
- **Step 3:** Scroll to the bottom of the page and find "**USB accessories**" in the "**Allow access when locked**" column.
- **Step 4:** Click **the toggle button on the right** to disable this feature.

After completing all the steps, your Apple iPhone XS can connect USB accessories anytime, anywhere. However, it is very common to forget to unlock the passcode. Next, we will recommend four solutions to help you use USB accessories without a passcode.
