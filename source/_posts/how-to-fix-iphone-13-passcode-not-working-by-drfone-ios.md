## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 13 is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 13 will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!

### Way 2. Restore iPhone From iTunes

Restoring an iPhone using iTunes is an alternative method for removing parental controls. iTunes is a multimedia management software that is developed by Apple. It provides various functions, including media playback and data synchronization. The most important function is the Apple iPhone 13 device backup and restoration. Restoring your Apple iPhone 13 via iTunes results in the complete erasure of all data and settings. Here is **how to disable restrictions on iPhones without password:**

- **Step 1.** Ensure that iTunes has been updated to the most recent version before opening the application. Connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the computer and grant iTunes permission to recognize the Apple iPhone 13 device. After detecting the Apple iPhone 13 device, access the "Summary" tab by tapping the Apple iPhone 13 device icon in iTunes. You can access the "Backups" section to create any backup before restoring.
