## 5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max in Lost Mode

Numerous security features make all Mac devices like iPhones, iPads, and Macs stand apart from the opposition in terms of user data safety. Lost Mode is one feature that locks your lost iPhone or other Apple devices so nobody can get to them.

If your device is gone, you can use the Find My application on your other Apple device connected to a similar account to **unlock the lost iPhone.**

If your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is in Lost Mode and you don't have the foggiest idea of how to restore it, relax. This guide will cover every one of the techniques that you can use for **iPhone Lost Mode unlock**.

## Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?

The Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Lock feature permits remotely locking a lost Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to prevent people from using its data. If you set a password for a device before enabling the Lost Mode, you will need this password to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max once it has returned to its proprietor.

The Lost Mode menu will ask you to set one if it has no password. Password is obligatory to stop Lost Mode once a device is returned to the owner, as Contact ID or Face ID won't work for this reason.

![lost mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-1.jpg)

**Send a Custom Text Message:** When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.

**Erase Data Remotely:** Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max if you believe it's been some time since it's gone and you don't think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.

**Track Your Device on Map:** An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

**Play Songs:** Playing a sound might assist you with finding your lost iPhone if it's still close by. The Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max will play a sound at top volume, no matter what volume level was set on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device when you lost it.

### 1\. Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode

The most straightforward method for unlocking the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max in Lost Mode is entering the password on the actual device. If your device was protected with a password before placing it in Lost Mode, enter it again.

If your device had no password while placing it in Lost Mode and you've entered it into iCloud while placing your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max into Lost Mode, utilize this password. That will help you **unlock lost iPhone**, and you can start operating your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max again.

### 2\. Remove it from Find My in iCloud

One more method for unlocking the Lost Mode on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is to utilize the Find My iPhone application on the official iCloud site. Follow the steps underneath to do so:

1. Go to <www.icloud.com> and utilize your account details to sign in.
2. Click the "Find My iPhone" button and select all iDevices.
3. Pick the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device you need to unlock in Lost Mode and tap the "Lost Mode" button.
4. Click the "Stop Lost Mode" button to remove the lock from the phone.
5. Confirm this activity by clicking the "Stop Lost Mode" button again.

### 3\. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone's information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device has an activation lock enabled.

The DNS bypass will send a fake "device isn't locked" message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to **unlock lost iPhone**:

- Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.
- A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the "I" icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap "Forget this Network."

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-2.jpg)

- Tap on "Configure DNS," and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:

USA: 104.154.51.7

Asia: 104.155.28.90

Europe: 104.155.28.90

South America: 35.199.88.219

Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23

- Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network. Click the Back button when a popup says that the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is attempting to connect to the Apple servers.
- You will now be on the DNS bypass screen. Pick the applications from the list to keep using your device. However, only a handful of applications are available through this.

### 4\. Use Emergency Call

This technique is the most widely recognized one. You can bypass your iCloud activation by settling on a fake Emergency call. Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won't work for everyone.

If your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your **iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:**

- Click the "Emergency Call" option on your locked device.

![emergency call](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg)

- Dial "\*#96274825\*0000\*1#," then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.
- If it's not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn't work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.
- Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again. Now create a new password after **iPhone Lost Mode unlock.**

### 5\. Apple iPhone Unlock

## Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking? Here's the Fix

## Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?

When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!

In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.

![encrypt local backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg)

Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup unlocking never set by you.

But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let's talk about them.

## Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password

Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.

One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.

There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

### 1\. Try all passwords you use on iPhone

When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?

To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.

A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.

Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.

### 2\. Find the password from Keychain on macOS

You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.

The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.

1. On your macOS, go to **Utilities** by clicking the **Applications** menu item. At this point, launch the **Keychain Access app** and look for your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup.
2. To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.
3. On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg)

### 3\. "Reset All Settings"

Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.

Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:

**Step 1:** Unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, and then open the **Settings** app on your device.

**Step 2:** After locating the **General** menu, go to the **Reset** menu and then hit the **Reset All Settings** button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.

**Step 4:** The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.

You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.

**Step 1:** Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max using iCloud.

**Step 2:** After you have opened the **Settings** app, go to the **General** menu, then to the **Reset** menu, and finally to the **Erase All Content and Settings** option.

![reset in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg)

**Step 3:** Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to factory settings, and wait until it is done.

**Step 4:** Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the **Apps & Data** option.

**Step 5:** Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.

You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.

On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.

### 4\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

**First step:** After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled **"Screen Unlock."**

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)
