## Part 1: Why You Need to "Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro to Use Accessories"?

Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers.
