## Part 1: Why You Need to "Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro to Use Accessories"?

The command comes from Apple’s significant privacy safeguard **“USB Restricted Mode”**. It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only.

Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.

In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers. To combat hackers including GrayKey and protect iOS users' data security, the USB Restricted Mode feature arrived with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018 and be improved in iOS12.
