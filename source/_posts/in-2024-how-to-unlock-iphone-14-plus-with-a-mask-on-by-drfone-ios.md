**Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode**

Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone 14 Plus lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can't actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.

**Step 3. Affirm iOS device information**

After putting the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.
