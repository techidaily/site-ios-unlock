We suggest you open the recovery mode to remove the iOS screen lock. However, if you can't figure out how to do so, go for the DFU mode.

**Step 3. Affirm Device Model information**

After going to the DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the information about your Apple iPhone 12 mini. From the following screen, confirm your phone model and iOS version. If it is isn't correctly given, select the correct data pair from the drop-down menu. Then download the firmware package for your Apple iPhone 12 mini.

**Step 4. Open the Lock**

Click Unlock Now after downloading the firmware.
