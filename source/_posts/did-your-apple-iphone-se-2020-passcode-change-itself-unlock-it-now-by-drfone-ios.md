**Option 1: Contact the Original Owner**

One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone SE (2020) ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.

**Option 2: Contact Your Carrier**

Your next option is to contact your carrier for an **iPhone blacklist removal service**. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone SE (2020). Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.

If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.

Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you're patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.

## Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted

Now that you've learned how to [rescue a blacklisted iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html) let's talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place. Prevention is always better than a cure, right? Here are some easy steps to make sure your Apple iPhone SE (2020) stays in the clear.

![how to avoid iphone blacklist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-04.jpg)

### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone SE (2020) Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone SE (2020). Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone SE (2020) getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone SE (2020)'s data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone SE (2020)'s status.

### Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone

If your Apple iPhone SE (2020) ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.

### Beware of Scams

Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid buying iPhones from unreliable sources or individuals you don't trust.

By following these simple preventive measures, you can keep your device clear and avoid the hassle of dealing with the whole **iPhone blacklist removal** process. Remember, a little caution goes a long way.
