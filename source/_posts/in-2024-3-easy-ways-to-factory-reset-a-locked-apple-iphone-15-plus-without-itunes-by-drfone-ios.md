## Part 4: About data loss after unlocking Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode

As you can see, in all the above-mentioned solutions, your Apple iPhone 15 Plus data would be lost while unlocking its passcode. This is because, as of now, there is no way to unlock an iPhone without restoring it. Needless to say, while restoring a device, its data is automatically lost. Since Apple is quite concerned about the security of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and the sensitivity of its data, it doesn’t let users unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device without losing their data.

Even though lots of users have complained about this issue, Apple hasn’t come up with a solution yet. The best way to avoid this scenario is by taking a regular backup of your data.
