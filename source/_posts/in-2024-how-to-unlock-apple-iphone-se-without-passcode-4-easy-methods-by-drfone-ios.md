## 5 Easy Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone SE without Passcode by Yourself

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the Find My iPhone function, then you can try it to unlock your Apple iPhone SE without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![use find My Apple iPhone SE to unlock iphone 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.

**Step 3:** Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.

**Step 4:** Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone SE from the list of devices.

**Step 5:** Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.

**Step 6:** Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone SE without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone SE:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone SE to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.

**Step 2:** Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.

**Step 3:** Once recognized, your Apple iPhone SE will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone SE:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone SE to the computer and launch the iTunes application.

**Step 2:** Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

**Step 3:** As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.

**Step 4:** On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone SE without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.

- **Step 3. Put iOS Into Recovery Mode and Specify Details**

Moving on, you must put your iOS device into Recovery Mode. For this, follow the instructions on the screen based on your Apple iPhone SE model. Once it is in Recovery Mode successfully, you need to verify the Apple iPhone SE device details. Verify the “Device Model,” select the specific "System Version," and continue to device unlocking by clicking "Start."

![select device model and version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

- **Step 4. Confirm the Unlocking Process and Successfully Execute**

As the respective iOS firmware downloads, wait a few minutes and press the "Unlock" button. A prompt window appears where you have to enter the code “00000” to confirm the screen unlocking process.

## Part 2. \[Old Ways\] Using Siri To Unlock Stolen iPhone

It might come as a surprise to you that Siri can be used to unlock a lost iPhone. When you seek the answer to **how to unlock a lost iPhone** with Siri, you need to be aware of a very specific pointer. It is necessary to note that this method only works for devices operating between iOS 8 and 11.

This later turned out to be an anomaly in Siri that led users to unlock their iOS devices. If you have a device running within this iOS version range, learn how to unlock it with the provided steps:

- **Step 1.** Start by activating the Siri on your iOS device. Ask a simple question about time, like "What time is it?" Once Siri is active, a clock will display on your device screen. Next, access the clock and find the “World Clock” screen on your Apple iPhone SE. Tap the “+” button at the screen's top right corner. Enter the name of any city in the “Search Bar,” tap Select All, and choose “Share.”

![access world clocks via siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-6.jpg)

- **Step 2.** In the sharing options, look for "Messages." As you access the next screen, type anything in the "To" section and continue to select it by navigating to the "Create a New Contact" option. When providing the contact details, tap the "Add Photo" button. Lead into the Photos app from there and swipe up the screen or press the "Home" button to access the home screen.

## Part 3. \[All Data Lost\] Trying Recovery Mode for Unlocking Stolen iPhone

Another lifesaver method to unlock stolen iPhones is by utilizing the Recovery Mode. For this purpose, users need to connect their iPhones to their PC using [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/). Its ability to facilitate data restoration makes it an effective method to unlock iOS devices. Rather than searching for “**I bought a lost iPhone how do I unlock it**,” simply follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1.** Connect your locked stolen Apple iPhone SE to the computer using a USB cable. To enter the Recovery Mode, you need to follow the steps below, depending on your Apple iPhone SE model:

- **For iPhone 8 and Later:** Press and release the "Volume Up" button, followed by the "Volume Down" button. Press and hold the "Side" button on the right side of the Apple iPhone SE device to activate Recovery Mode.
- **For iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:** Press and hold the "Volume Down" and "Side/Power" buttons to enable Recovery Mode in iPhone 7 models.
- **For iPhone 6 and Earlier:** To activate Recovery Mode, press and hold the "Home" and "Side/Power" buttons until the respective screen displays.

![putting iphone in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-8.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Once your Apple iPhone SE is in Recovery Mode, iTunes will detect it automatically. A pop-up window will appear within iTunes to detect some problems with the Apple iPhone SE device. Tap the "Restore" button to start the process and unlock your Apple iPhone SE by erasing all settings and content.

## Part 4. Using Third-Party Unlocking Service To Unlock Stolen iPhone

In certain scenarios, when an iPhone gets stolen, it might enable the “Activation Lock.” This usually occurs to prevent the unauthorized access and usage of the Apple iPhone SE device. When you face such a situation, third-party unlocking services can help you bypass the Activation Lock.

These services include [IMEIUnlockSIM](https://www.imeiunlocksim.com/unlock-phone/icloud-activation-lock-removal-services/), [IMEICHECK.CO](https://imeicheck.co/product/icloud-removal/) and [Apple iPhone Unlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/en_gb). Below, we have outlined steps for using Apple iPhone Unlock to help you with **how do I unlock a stolen iPhone** issue:

**Instructions:** First, access the Apple iPhone Unlock official website and enter the IMEI number of the Apple iPhone SE device. Select the particular iOS device model and continue to select “Remove Activation Lock.” Following this, review the order summary and pay the fee with the required option. Upon successful completion of payment, the service will contact you for instant unlocking within 24 hours.
