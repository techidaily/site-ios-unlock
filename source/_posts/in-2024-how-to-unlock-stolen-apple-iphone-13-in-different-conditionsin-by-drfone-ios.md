## Part 5: How to Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Using Siri

If you do not have any potential source for unlocking your Apple iPhone 13, you can consider using Siri for this purpose. Here are the steps to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 lock screen using Siri.

**Step 1:** You need to activate Siri on your Apple iPhone 13. Keep holding the Home button or Side button according to your Apple iPhone 13 model for activating it. When activated, speak “What time is it” to it.
