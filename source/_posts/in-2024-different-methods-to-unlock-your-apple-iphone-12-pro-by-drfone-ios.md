### Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection

[<u>Network inconsistencies</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html) can often disrupt the authentication process. This can be the leading cause behind persistent password prompts. To ensure a stable connection, ensure that you are connected to a reliable and stable Wi-Fi network. You can also try toggling the Wi-Fi and mobile data switches on and off.

Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.

### Fix 4. Using the Mail Toggle as a Remedy

A strategic approach to resolving authentication issues involves using the Mail toggle. You can use it to disable and re-enable the email services. This action essentially resets the Outlook app's connection and can be performed as follows:

- **Step 1.** Within your Apple iPhone 12 Pro's "Settings" app, scroll down and tap "Mail." On the following screen, press "Accounts" and choose the "Outlook" account.

### Fix 9. Try Other Alternatives to Outlook

Exploring alternative mail applications may offer a viable workaround. This is especially true if the **iPhone asking for the Outlook password** proves resistant to previous solutions. Consider using other email platforms such as Apple Mail, [<u>Gmail</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-gmail-phone-verification.html), and Yahoo Mail. This solution might not directly resolve the issue with Outlook. Yet, an alternative can provide a temporary workaround until a solution is found.
