## Part 1. Can I Use an Apple Watch To Unlock My Apple iPhone 13 mini?

![phone, earphones, and apple watch on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-2.jpg)

The Apple iPhone 13 mini face ID is one of the simplest, most practical ways to unlock your phone. While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.

With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.

The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.

What could work is your Apple Watch.

Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 13 mini model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. It’s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.

## Part 2. Requirements for Unlocking Apple iPhone 13 mini With Apple Watch

![unlock requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-3.jpg)

Unfortunately, not every Apple iPhone 13 mini can be unlocked with your Apple Watch, and not every Apple Watch can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini. Both devices must meet some requirements before you can adjust your settings to enable this option.

To be able to use your Apple Watch to unlock your phone with the utmost ease, you’ll need:

- An Apple iPhone 13 mini with Face ID – Apple iPhone 13 mini X and newer models;
- iOS 14.5 and newer versions;
- An Apple Watch series 3 and newer models;
- watchOS 7.4 and newer versions.

Additional requirements you’ll need to meet include:

- Your Apple iPhone 13 mini and Apple Watch need to be paired;
- Both devices need to have WiFi and Bluetooth turned on (but a connection to a WiFi network isn’t necessary);
- You need to have a passcode on your Apple Watch;
- Wrist detection on your watch needs to be turned on;
- The watch needs to be on your wrist and unlocked.

You’ll also need to wear items such as sunglasses, face coverings, ski masks, or others that prevent you from using your Apple iPhone 13 mini Face ID.

## Part 3. How To Unlock Apple iPhone 13 mini With an Apple Watch

![a cyclist wearing an apple watch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-4.jpg)

If you meet all the aforementioned criteria, setting up the feature to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini using an Apple Watch is easy. You’ll just have to follow a few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode**on your Apple iPhone 13 mini;

![iphone face id and passcode settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-5.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode;
- **Step 3:** Find and enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**.

Remember that your Apple Watch’s wrist detection must be turned on for this option to work. When you tap to enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**, if your wrist detection isn’t turned on, you’ll get a prompt on your phone asking you to turn it on.

You can turn on wrist detection on your watch by following these steps:

- **Step 4:** Go to **Settings**on your Apple Watch;
- **Step 5:** Tap on the **Passcode**;
- **Step 6:** Toggle **Wrist Detection**

![apple watch wrist detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-6.jpg)

Now that you’ve enabled the option to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini using your Apple Watch, it’s time to simply start using the feature. To unlock your phone, you’ll need to:

- Have your Apple Watch on your wrist, unlocked;
- Tap on your Apple iPhone 13 mini or raise it to your face to activate it;
- Glance at your phone while wearing a face mask, sunglasses, or another item that’s preventing you from using Face ID;
- Swipe up on your phone’s screen.

Your Apple Watch will send an alert when you’ve used it to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini. If you accidentally unlock your phone, simply tap on the **Lock Apple iPhone 13 mini** on the screen of your watch to lock it.

However, remember that the next time you want to use your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini, you’ll first need to type in your passcode.

## Part 4. What To Do if You Can’t Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 mini With a Watch

![person wearing face mask unlocking their Apple iPhone 13 mini](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-7.jpg)

Generally speaking, unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 mini with an Apple Watch should be a simple, seamless task. Unfortunately, though, that’s not always the case. A glitch or a bug could be preventing you from enjoying this feature, so take a look at a few things you could try to fix it.

### 1. Check All Settings & Reconfigure

As mentioned earlier, there are a few requirements that your devices need to meet to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini with your Apple Watch.

If you’re using the correct versions of Apple iPhone 13 mini (iPhone X, iOS 14.5 and newer) and Apple Watch (series 3, watchOS 7.4 and newer), try to reconfigure your settings.

Make sure that you have:

- A passcode on your watch;
- Wrist detection turned on;
- Feature **Unlock with Apple Watch**turned on on your Apple iPhone 13 mini.

If all the settings are correct, try one of the following options.

### 2. Restart Your WiFi/Bluetooth Connection

Your Apple iPhone 13 mini and your Apple Watch need to have both WiFi and Bluetooth turned on. If they’re turned on on both devices, try turning them off and back on again to restart the connection.

Remember, you only need WiFi and Bluetooth on but don’t need to be connected to a WiFi network.

If the problem persists, you could also restart your devices and try again.

### 3. Reset Your Face ID

In some instances, it’s the Face ID feature that’s causing trouble, so you might want to try and reset it. It’s much easier than it may sound, you just need to follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s **Settings**;
- **Step 2:** Select **Face ID & Passcode**;
- **Step 3:** Tap **Reset Face ID**.

When you tap on this, you’ll need to go through the process of setting your Face ID as usual. You’ll need to type in your passcode, hold your Apple iPhone 13 mini in front of you (in portrait orientation), tap to get started, and put your face in the provided frame.

Move your face to complete the circle, then tap on **Continue**. Repeat the face scan process the second time and select **Done**.

### 4. Do a System Repair on Your Apple iPhone 13 mini

If your Apple Watch unlock is still misbehaving, you might need to do a full system repair. As a general rule of thumb, it’s best to use verified apps like Dr.Fone to prevent the problem from getting worse.

[<u>Dr.Fone Apple iPhone 13 mini system repair</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/ios-system-recovery.html) is designed to be fast, efficient, and safe. It can repair virtually any system glitch in less than five minutes, ensuring your phone operates seamlessly.

To perform a standard system repair with Dr.Fone, follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Download and launch Dr.Fone on your computer;
- **Step 2:** From the **Toolbox**on your left-hand side, select **System Repair**;

![unlock-iphone-with-watch-8.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

- **Step 3:** Connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to your PC using a cable connection;
- **Step 4:** Select your device type in the new window that opens;
- **Step 5:** Select **iOS repair**;

![dr.fone ios repair](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/ios-system-repair-1.png)

- **Step 6:** Select **Standard Repair Mode**;
- **Step 7:** Follow the on-screen instructions and select **Enter Recovery Mode**;
- (Alternatively, select **Guide**if your phone is unresponsive);
- **Step 8:** Select the iOS firmware you want to download and install on your device;
- **Step 9:** Wait for the download to finish, then select **Repair Now**;
- **Step 10:** Wait until the process is complete, then select **Done**.

![dr.fone finishing ios repair](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/ios-system-repair-8.png)

If it was a system mistake preventing you from unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 mini with your Apple Watch, the option should be functioning well after the Dr.Fone iOS repair.

### 5. Reset Network Settings

If the problem wasn’t due to a system glitch, you should try resetting your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s network settings. The process is simple, just:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network**;
- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode.

Resetting your network settings will clear out data from your internet, local network, and devices, including WiFi passwords, some Bluetooth connections, and more. However, your paired devices, such as the Apple Watch, shouldn’t be removed.

### 6. Reset Your Watch and Pair It Again

Finally, if you’re still experiencing issues, you might need to reset your Apple Watch and pair it with your Apple iPhone 13 mini again.

It’s all quite simple:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button;
- **Step 2:** Drag the slider under **Power off**to the right;
- **Step 3:** Press and hold the power button to turn the Apple iPhone 13 mini device back on.

To perform a hard reset, simultaneously press and hold the power button and digital crown.

## Conclusion

Using your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini is convenient when you cannot use the Face ID feature. It allows you to seamlessly unlock your phone when wearing sunglasses, goggles, face masks, or other face coverings that prevent the Face ID from working.

Enabling this option is a straightforward process, and if there’s ever a glitch, there are several options you could try to repair it.
