Unlocking an iPhone without a passcode is possible, but it's not as simple as entering a code. Besides, there are different methods that you can follow to unlock your Apple iPhone XS on 11/12/13.

And we are going to teach all those methods with some simple steps. So, without any further ado, let's get started.

![unlock iphone 11 12 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-2.jpg)

## 5 Easy Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone XS without Passcode by Yourself

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the Find My iPhone function, then you can try it to unlock your Apple iPhone XS without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![use find My Apple iPhone XS to unlock iphone 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.

**Step 3:** Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.

**Step 4:** Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone XS from the list of devices.

**Step 5:** Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.

**Step 6:** Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone XS without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone XS:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone XS to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.

**Step 2:** Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.

**Step 3:** Once recognized, your Apple iPhone XS will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone XS:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone XS to the computer and launch the iTunes application.

**Step 2:** Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

**Step 3:** As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.

**Step 4:** On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone XS without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.
