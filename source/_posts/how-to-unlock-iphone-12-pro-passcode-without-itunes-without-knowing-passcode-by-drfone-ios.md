### 2\. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud

No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 12 Pro will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

### 3\. Unlock it with iTunes

Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 12 Pro in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.

Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.

**On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the power off slider. Next, move the slider to turn off the iPhone. Then, press the Volume (-) button and connect the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.**

After you connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the "Your iPhone name" and ask you to restore it. In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn't run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Keep waiting until the restoration completes. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and follow the on-screen directions. That will allow you to set up and utilize your device.
