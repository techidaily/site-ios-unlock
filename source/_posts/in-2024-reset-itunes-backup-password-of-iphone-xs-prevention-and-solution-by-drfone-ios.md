## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone XS backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

If you forget your password, you will be required to reset it before being able to access your backups again.

### iCloud and iTunes Backup Password

Resetting your password may be done in different methods, depending on whether or not you have an iCloud account. You may reset your iCloud password by visiting the iCloud website and following the steps. This requires that you already have an iCloud account.

Connecting your device to a computer and using the iTunes program will allow you to reset your password even if you do not have an iCloud account. After successfully changing your password, you can access your backups the same way as before.

![password security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/reset-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

### Basic Ways for Password Security

To reset your password, go to the **Preferences** menu in iTunes, and click on the **Reset Password** button. You will be prompted to enter your old password and a new one. Please choose a strong password that cannot be easily guessed.

In addition, iCloud requires you to enter your Apple ID and password to access your backup file. This means that only you can access your backup and that it will be more difficult for someone else to gain access to it.
