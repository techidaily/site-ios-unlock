### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 14 passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 14 in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 14 device.

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 14, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 14 and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.
