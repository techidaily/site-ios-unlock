![turn off passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-without-face-id-7.jpg)

## Part 3: Can I bypass my iPhone Face ID with a picture?

As indicated by Apple, the short and obvious answer is no.

FaceID isn't simply a camera snapping a picture. It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1/1 million, compared to 1/50000 with Touch ID.

It doesn't work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.

### The Bottom Line

That's all about our take on **how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.** We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand. However, we strongly suggest Dr.Fone if you still face issues with our solutions. Even if the above methods fail, Dr.Fone will ensure you unlock your phone.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 15 Pro, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 15 Pro in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.
