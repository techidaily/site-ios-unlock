## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 12

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 12, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 12:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 12 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 12 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

All Apple iPhone 12 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 12 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 12 12 mini was.
