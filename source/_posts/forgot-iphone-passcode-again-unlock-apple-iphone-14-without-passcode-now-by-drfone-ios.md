Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 14 device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 14 without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 14 is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 14 device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

## Reset iTunes Backup Password Of Apple iPhone 14: Prevention & Solution

When you back up the data from your Apple iPhone 14, iPad, or iPod touch, you will have a copy of the information stored on those devices. It's free to use iTunes, iCloud, or both to back up your device.

If you have forgotten the password to your backup, you may reset your Apple iPhone 14 backup password by following these instructions. The process to reset the iTunes backup password is simple within only a few minutes.

To get started, please follow the instructions that are listed below.

![itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/reset-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg)

## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone 14 backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

If you forget your password, you will be required to reset it before being able to access your backups again.

### iCloud and iTunes Backup Password

Resetting your password may be done in different methods, depending on whether or not you have an iCloud account. You may reset your iCloud password by visiting the iCloud website and following the steps. This requires that you already have an iCloud account.

Connecting your device to a computer and using the iTunes program will allow you to reset your password even if you do not have an iCloud account. After successfully changing your password, you can access your backups the same way as before.

![password security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/reset-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

To improve the safety of your Apple iPhone 14 backup, you should first change the password for your iTunes backup. This will guarantee that no one else can see your backup file and that only you can access it. No one else will have chance to get it.

### Basic Ways for Password Security

To reset your password, go to the **Preferences** menu in iTunes, and click on the **Reset Password** button. You will be prompted to enter your old password and a new one. Please choose a strong password that cannot be easily guessed.

Another way to enhance the security of your Apple iPhone 14 backup is to use iCloud instead of iTunes. iCloud offers an extra layer of security, as your backup file will be encrypted when transmitted to iCloud.

In addition, iCloud requires you to enter your Apple ID and password to access your backup file. This means that only you can access your backup and that it will be more difficult for someone else to gain access to it.
