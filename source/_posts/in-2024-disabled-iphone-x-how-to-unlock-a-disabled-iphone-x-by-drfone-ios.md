Because of using face masks, [Face ID](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone-13.html) on iPhone does not always work correctly, and we are entering our passcodes more than before. If we enter it incorrectly a few times in succession, the phone will disable itself to prevent unauthorized access. It can seem like the end of the world because in so many ways smartphones have become our world. Here are ways you can unlock your Apple iPhone X disabled due to too many incorrect passcode attempts.

## Part 1: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone X Without iTunes/ iCloud Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)

We know and understand that the word troubleshooting can remind you of long telephone calls with support or making appointments and driving down to specialists and spending obscene amounts of money to get solutions. You do not want that. How about a way you could [unlock your Apple iPhone X](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-an-iphone-13.html) in a simple, 1-click way instead?

It comprises modules designed to help you with all the issues that you might encounter during smartphone use. Naturally, there is something to help you when your Apple iPhone X is disabled. You don't need to use anything else, no other software or special cable or support. All you need is this one software you can download on your computer (both macOS and Windows supported) and you're good to go.

**3981454** people have downloaded it

Do note that all methods that unlock your Apple iPhone X will necessarily wipe your Apple iPhone X and remove all data from the Apple iPhone X device, essentially booting it up as new.

**Step 1:** Launch Dr.Fone and click the module titled "Screen Unlock".

**Step 2:** Choose the "iOS" option, then select "Unlock iOS Screen" on the subsequent screen to continue unlocking your Apple iPhone X.

![screen unlock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-1.png)

**Step 3:** Follow the provided instructions to start the disabled Apple iPhone X in Recovery Mode to unlock it. If for any reason the phone does not boot in Recovery Mode, there are instructions provided at the bottom to enter what is called DFU mode.

![device page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone will read and display your phone model and the software installed on it. If the model displayed is incorrect, use the dropdown to pick the correct detail. Click "Start" to download the specific firmware file for your particular Apple iPhone X model.

![download firmware](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5:** After the download completes, please click Unlock Now to start unlocking the disabled Apple iPhone X.

![start unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

Your Apple iPhone X will be unlocked in a short span of time. Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the Apple iPhone X device. When you set the Apple iPhone X device up again, if you set it to use iCloud, data such as Contacts, iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive data, etc. will be downloaded onto your device again. The apps you had on your Apple iPhone X prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the Apple iPhone X device again.

## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone X Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone X to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone X and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone X) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![restore iphone to factory settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone X and unlock your Apple iPhone X.

When the Apple iPhone X reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.

## Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone X Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)

Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone X is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn't require going through complex hoops.

Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone X, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone X.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone X.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone X.

![icloud find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.

This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone X remotely and your Apple iPhone X will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone X once again.

## Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone X Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone X. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone X.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone X from the Apple iPhone X devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone X and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone X Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone X with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone X or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone X.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone X and return the Apple iPhone X device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone X is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone X with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone X easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone X again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone X, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone X disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone X device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

Unlocking a phone using a passcode is a great way to keep your data safe. To secure your device, you can set a 4-digit, 6-digit, fingerprint, or Face ID. However, what will happen if you **forgot iPhone PIN?** You will not be able to unlock and use the services of your device.

## Part 1: 4 Simple Ways to Unlock iPhone without Pin

### 1\. "Erase iPhone" option

The steps below work if your Apple iPhone X or iPad runs iOS 15.2 or later and is connected to the internet. Here's what you need to do when you **forgot iPhone PIN**:

- Please enter your password a few times from your device's Lock Screen until it requests that you attempt another time. Then repeat this activity until you see the Erase iPhone choice in the corner of the screen.
- Tap Erase iPhone, then click again to confirm your activity.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-1.jpg)

- Enter your Apple account details to sign out of your Apple ID on the phone.
- Tap Erase iPhone back to erase all your user data and settings for all time.
- At the point when the iOS device restarts, adhere to the on-screen directions. Set your phone once more, and restore your data and settings from a backup. Now set a new password for your device.

**Instructions to Restore a Locked iPhone Running iOS 15.1 or Prior**

- To begin with, put your Apple iPhone X into DFU recovery mode.
- Then, connect it to a PC or Macintosh through a Lightning link.
- Select your Apple iPhone X in the Finder sidebar on Mac or iTunes on the PC.
- Pick Restore when you see the choice to Restore. Let the download finish if the download takes over 15 minutes and your device leaves the recovery mode screen. Then, at that point, turn off your Apple iPhone X and start once more.

![click restore](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-2.jpg)

- Disconnect your Apple iPhone X, then, at that point, turn it on and set it up. That's all you need to do.

### 2\. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud

Apple allows clients to erase iPhone data to safeguard it from others remotely. However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don't erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone X will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

To unlock iPhone through iCloud:

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.

**Step 2.** Click the "Find iPhone" option from the different choices available.

**Step 3.** Click "All Devices" and pick the Apple iPhone X device you need to unlock.

**Step 4.** Click the "Erase iPhone" button. Subsequently, set up the Apple iPhone X device and set another lock screen PIN. With iCloud, you can unlock your iDevice without even touching your device.

![icloud unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-3.jpg)

### 3\. Unlock it with iTunes

Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone X in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone X device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone X. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.

Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.

Additionally, ensure that you keep your iDevices' Apple ID details safe. Else, you will not have the option to use the iDevice again. Using iTunes will erase the screen's password but not the firmware. Considering that, you must keep the information in mind to set up and utilize the Apple iPhone X device.

To sidestep iPhone password with iTunes:

**Step 1. Go to Recovery mode**

**On iPhone 8/8 Or more and Above:** Hold the power/side button and press any of the volume buttons until a slider appears. Move the slider to turn off the Apple iPhone X device. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone X to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone X device shows the recovery mode screen.

**On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the power off slider. Next, move the slider to turn off the iPhone. Then, press the Volume (-) button and connect the Apple iPhone X device to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone X.**

After you connect your Apple iPhone X to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the "Your iPhone name" and ask you to restore it. In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn't run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Keep waiting until the restoration completes. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone X and follow the on-screen directions. That will allow you to set up and utilize your device.

## Part 2: FAQs

### How can I change my PIN on my iPhone?

- Open your Settings app and peer down until you see the passcode menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Touch ID and Passcode." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Passcode."
