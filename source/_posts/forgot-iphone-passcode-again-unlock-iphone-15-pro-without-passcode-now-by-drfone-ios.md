It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

- Not user-friendly

### The Bottom Line

I have high hopes that this list will enable you to get the very finest iPhone backup Unlocker Software. This list is vetted and narrowed down to include just those items with advanced features and outstanding performance.

All of the software that was described is accessible for both Mac and Windows operating systems, and some of it even has a trial version that you can use to test it out. However, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is the ideal option as an iPhone backup unlocker you should try first!
