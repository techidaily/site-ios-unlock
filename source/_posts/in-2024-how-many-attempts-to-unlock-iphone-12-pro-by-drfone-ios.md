**Step 1. Plug the iDevice into your system**

Run the Dr.Fone on your system and select the "Screen Unlock" option from the main menu.

![select screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Use a connector to connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the PC. After this, click the "Unlock iOS Screen" option on the program.

**Step 2. Access the Recovery or DFU Mode**

Before the Apple iPhone 12 Pro lock screen removal, we need to boot the phone in Recovery or DFU. If you have to do so, follow the steps given in the image below:

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

We suggest you open the recovery mode to remove the iOS screen lock. However, if you can't figure out how to do so, go for the DFU mode.

**Step 3. Affirm Device Model information**

After going to the DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the information about your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. From the following screen, confirm your phone model and iOS version. If it is isn't correctly given, select the correct data pair from the drop-down menu. Then download the firmware package for your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.

**Step 4. Open the Lock**

Click Unlock Now after downloading the firmware.

After a short while, your Apple iPhone 12 Pro will be opened effectively. However, this process will erase every bit of data off your phone. Honestly speaking, there is no answer for this issue without data loss.
