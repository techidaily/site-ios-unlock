iTunes is one of the most used and innovational software pioneered by Apple. It has proved to be the best software out there through its versatility and exceptional performance. This software is your savior if you’re looking for something to organize your files in iPhone as it has great integration with iOS.

**Step 1: Connect to Computer**

The first step is to connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to the computer with which you've synced previously.

**Step 2: Recovery Mode and Synchronize**

Now open iTunes. If it asks for a passcode, try another computer that you've synced your device with. Else, put your phone to Recovery mode. Wait for iTunes to detect and sync your device. It will then create a backup.

**Step 4: Restore**

Once your device is synced with iTunes, a "Set Up" window will pop up on the screen displaying two options, "Restore" or "Update." Select "Restore" to proceed further.

### 3.2 Apple iCloud Feature

iCloud is a multifunctional drive compatible with iOS and macOS. It saves your data, your media and organizes your files in folders. Moreover, it allows the user to share media, data, files, and even location with the other iPhone/iOS user. The major feature of Apple iCloud is its ‘Backup’ which stores all your data in case you lose or damage your phone.

To fix the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode, which is not working, iCloud can come in handy. But this method can only work if you've logged in to your iCloud account on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and your "Find My iPhone" application is turned on. All you have to do is erase your data which will automatically erase your passcode through iCloud.

**Step 1: Sign in with Apple ID**

First, open iCloud.com on another iOS and write your credentials to sign in your Apple ID.

**Step 2: Select your Device**

Click on "Find My iPhone" and select "All devices," and a list of devices will come up which are working under the same Apple ID. Select your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.
