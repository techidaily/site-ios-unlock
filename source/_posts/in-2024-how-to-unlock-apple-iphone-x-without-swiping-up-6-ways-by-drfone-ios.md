## Part 3: How to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode with iTunes?

Another popular way to restore your Apple iPhone X is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Needless to say, even though you would be able to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode, the technique will wipe the data on your device. Though, if you have already taken a backup of your data, then you can choose to restore it after performing an Apple iPhone X bypass. Do it by following these instructions.

**Step 1.** Launch iTunes on your system and connect it with a USB/lightning cable.

**Step 2.** Hold the Home button on your Apple iPhone X and while pressing it, connect it to your system. This will display a connect-to-iTunes symbol.
