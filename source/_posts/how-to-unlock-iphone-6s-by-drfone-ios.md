2. **Financial Exploitation:**With access to your Apple iPhone 6s, thieves may attempt to get stored payment methods.
3. **Identity Theft:** Stolen iPhones often contain a wealth of sensitive information. This makes them a prime target for identity theft.

## Part 2. Use Find My To Locate Stolen iPhone

On learning about **how do I lock my stolen iPhone**, Apple's robust [<u>Find My</u>](https://www.icloud.com/find) feature emerges as a beacon of hope. It uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth signals to locate your Apple iPhone 6s accurately.
