![find My Apple iPhone 12 Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg)

Just follow the steps below and get started.

- **Step 2:** Select "All Devices" at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 12 Pro from the list of devices.

Once your Apple iPhone 12 Pro has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

![with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg)

## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings
