## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly.

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.
