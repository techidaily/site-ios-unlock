## Unlocking Apple iPhone 6 Plus  Lock Screen: 3 Foolproof Methods that Actually Work

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

The competition in the market between Android and iOS has been increased ever since the features are increasing. People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.

Looking more into the Apple iPhone 6 Plus world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 6 Plus . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.

## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 6 Plus  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 6 Plus  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

**Step 5.** When finished, tap the "Respring" option at the bottom to apply your changes. At last, unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus using your Face ID effortlessly.

### Method 5: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up via Voice Control

There are situations where manual interaction might be challenging. Here's a guide on how to set up and use “Voice Control” to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus:

**Step 1.** Open the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and scroll down to tap “Accessibility.” On the following screen, press “Voice Control” to proceed further.

### Method 6: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up with Switch Control

Utilizing Switch Control is an excellent accessibility feature on iOS devices. It allows users to interact with their iPhones using adaptive switches or the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device's screen itself. Moreover, it can provide an alternative way to navigate the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and access the Home screen. You no longer have to rely solely on the conventional swipe gesture. Here is how you can set up switch control to **iPhone swipe to unlock**:

**Step 1.** Access your Apple iPhone 6 Plus's Settings, then tap on "Accessibility." Now find and select "Switch Control," and within it, navigate to "Switches." Now, tap "Add New Switch" and choose "Camera."

**Step 2.** Set Left Head Movement and Right Head Movement separately to “Home.” This action will lock the screen when tilting your head left or right. Now go back to "Recipes" in Switch Control, select "Edit," and delete all existing recipes.

![remove existing recipes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-9.jpg)

**Step 3.** Set "Scanning Style" to "Single Switch Step Scanning" and adjust "Dwell Time" to the shortest duration. Then, turn off the remaining settings under Switch Control.

![reduce dwell time as needed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-10.jpg)

**Step 4.** Save your switch, return to Accessibility Settings, and locate “Accessibility Shortcut.” Now, set triple-clicking the side button to activate “Switch Control.” On the home screen, triple-click the Side button, as previously set, to activate the switch on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Now, lock the Apple iPhone 6 Plus screen and then wake the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device without looking at it.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we have explored different ways to **unlock iPhones without swiping up** beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We've talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.

While these methods are helpful, there's a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that's particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can't get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called "Screen Unlock" that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.
