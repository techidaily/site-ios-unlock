### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad, or iPod Contact.**
