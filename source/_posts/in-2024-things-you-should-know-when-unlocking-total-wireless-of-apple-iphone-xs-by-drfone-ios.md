You can follow these steps to bypass the Apple iPhone XS passcode with Siri.

**Step 1**. Firstly, hold the Home button on our phone to activate Siri. Speak a command like “Siri, what time is it?” to ask the present time. Now, tap on the clock icon.

## Part 3: How to bypass the Apple iPhone XS passcode with iTunes?

Another popular way to restore your Apple iPhone XS is by taking the assistance of iTunes.

**Step 1.** Launch iTunes on your system and connect it with a USB/lightning cable.

**Step 2.** Hold the Home button on your Apple iPhone XS and while pressing it, connect it to your system. This will display a connect-to-iTunes symbol.
