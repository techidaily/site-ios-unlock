### 2\. Backup Your Data

Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) is an excellent alternative.

### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time.

- **Step 1:** Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max with a USB cable.
- **Step 2**: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button.

If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max exits recovery mode, you'll need to repeat the steps.

### Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone

After **many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max**，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.

Once you've chosen the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, click the **Erase iPhone** icon in the lower-right corner. Although the action deletes the data on the phone, you can retrieve it from your iCloud backup once the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is operational again.

### Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store
