This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 12 mini with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 12 mini Locked?

In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 12 mini does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.
