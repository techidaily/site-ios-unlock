## Part 2. \[Old Ways\] Using Siri To Unlock Stolen iPhone

It might come as a surprise to you that Siri can be used to unlock a lost iPhone. When you seek the answer to **how to unlock a lost iPhone** with Siri, you need to be aware of a very specific pointer. It is necessary to note that this method only works for devices operating between iOS 8 and 11.

This later turned out to be an anomaly in Siri that led users to unlock their iOS devices. If you have a device running within this iOS version range, learn how to unlock it with the provided steps:

- **Step 1.** Start by activating the Siri on your iOS device. Ask a simple question about time, like "What time is it?" Once Siri is active, a clock will display on your device screen. Next, access the clock and find the “World Clock” screen on your Apple iPhone 12 mini. Tap the “+” button at the screen's top right corner. Enter the name of any city in the “Search Bar,” tap Select All, and choose “Share.”

When providing the contact details, tap the "Add Photo" button. Lead into the Photos app from there and swipe up the screen or press the "Home" button to access the home screen.
