Two things can happen on the tenth failed attempt to unlock your Apple iPhone 15. If you have **Erase Data** enabled, your phone's data gets wiped. If it's disabled, the Apple iPhone 15 is permanently locked, requiring a connection to iTunes for restoration. It's crucial to [<u>back up your data on iCloud</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html) or locally to avoid permanent loss.

## Part 2. What Are the Consequences After Consecutive Failed Attempts?

It can initiate a data wipe or lock the iPhone, needing a connection to iTunes for restoration. After a series of failed attempts, the Apple iPhone 15 can activate a security measure often referred to as a "self-destruct" mode.

To turn this mode on or off, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.
