You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.

From USB-A to the latest, USB-C. Also, most iPhones use a proprietary Lightning port.
