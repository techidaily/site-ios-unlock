And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?

A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.

If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.

### Conclusion

It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.

But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 6s gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone? The ways outlined in this guide will help you unlock your disabled iPhone.
