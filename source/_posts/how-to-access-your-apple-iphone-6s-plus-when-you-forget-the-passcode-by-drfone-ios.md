You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 6s Plus models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 6s Plus models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 6s Plus 12 mini was.
