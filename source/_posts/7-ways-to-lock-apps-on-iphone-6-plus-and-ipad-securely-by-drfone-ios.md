## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 6 Plus

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In

Sometimes, simply [<u>signing out of your Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html) and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the **Settings** app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to **Sign Out**. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.

Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure. Regularly checking your Apple ID settings and payment information can prevent many common issues with the App Store, including the frustrating ‘Verification Required’ prompt.

**Creating a new Apple ID** isn't just about getting a new email; it's about tailoring your Apple experience to your needs, whether for personalization, privacy, or organization. Now that you know why it's essential, let's explore how to create it in the next section.

## Part 2: Step-by-Step Guide: How To Create a New Apple ID Account

**Creating a new Apple ID for free** is a straightforward process. Let's break it down into simple steps:

### A. Registering a New Apple ID

These are the steps for registering a new Apple ID:

- **Step 1:** Open your web browser and visit the [<u>Apple ID account management page</u>](http://appleid.apple.com/). Click the **Create Your Apple ID** button to begin.

![apple id account management page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/create-new-apple-id-account-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** On the registration page, you'll be asked to provide your **First name** and **Last name**. Make sure to use the name associated with your new Apple ID. Next, you'll need to enter your preferred email address. This one will be your new Apple ID.

**Tip:** Choose an email that's easy to remember and access.

![create your apple id step 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/create-new-apple-id-account-04.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Create a strong password that combines letters, numbers, and symbols. This password is essential for the security of your account, so make it unique and hard to guess. Confirm your password by entering it again in the designated field.

### B. Verifying Your Identity

The next step is verifying your identity. Check out the steps below:

- **Step 4:** Apple takes your security seriously. You may be asked to provide a phone number to verify your identity. This number can be used for account recovery or two-factor authentication. The phone number you provided will receive a verification code. Enter this code in the space provided to confirm your identity.

**Note:** It's crucial to ensure that your phone number is accurate and accessible. This number will help you recover your account in case you forget your password or encounter any issues. Apple may use this phone number for two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of security to your account.

![create your apple id step 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/create-new-apple-id-account-05.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Apple may sometimes ask you to complete a **CAPTCHA** or verify your identity to prevent automated account creation.

### C. Setting Up Security Questions

The next process will be setting up security questions for your account:

- **Step 6:** Apple asks you to choose and answer security questions. These questions provide an additional layer of protection for your account. Select questions that you can easily remember and that others can't guess.

### D. Finalizing the Process

To finalize the creation process, refer to the steps given below:

- **Step 7:** Read through Apple's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. Once you've understood them, tick the box to confirm that you've read and agree to the iCloud and Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. Then click **Agree** to proceed. Remember that it's essential to be familiar with Apple's policies to ensure a secure and smooth experience.
