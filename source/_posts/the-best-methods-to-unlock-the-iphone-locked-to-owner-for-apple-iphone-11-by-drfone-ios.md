## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone 11

Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 11 device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 11 device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 11 device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 11 device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 11 device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone 11 device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 11 device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 11 Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone 11 locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 11 device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 11 device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 11:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 11 device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 11:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 11 device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 11 to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.

The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 11 device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Activation Lock:

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 11 is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 11 Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.
- ****Step 2:**** Select "More Wi-Fi Settings" using the "i" symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose "Configure DNS" and follow it by selecting the "Manual" option.
- ****Step 3:**** Afterward, press "Add Server," located under "DNS Servers." Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:

- For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90
- For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58
- For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60

![use the dns method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg)

### Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service

What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn't working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone 11. All you need to provide them is your Apple iPhone 11 IMEI number. The process is done remotely and takes 24 to 48 hours to complete.

Ensure your device IMEI is not blacklisted before sending it for the unlocking process. Described below are steps to use [<u>DirectUnlocks</u>](https://directunlocks.com/en_us/icloud-unlock), an iCloud Activation removal service:

- ****Step 1:**** Use your computer's browser to visit the official DriectUnlocks website. Enter your Apple iPhone 11's IMEI number and select the Apple iPhone 11 model in the provided box.
- ****Step 2:**** Once you have entered the details, tap "Remove Activation Lock." Afterward, select a payment method to pay for the service. It will take up to 48 hours to unlock your device.

Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the "Toolbox" tab, navigate to "Screen Unlock" and select "iOS." In the following window, choose "iCloud Activation Lock Removal" and click "Start" to begin the process and receive a prompt to connect your iOS device. Once connected, the window will display the progress status.

- **Step 2. Device Identification and Unlock Initiation**

Now, decide whether your device is GSM or CDMA, as it is an important aspect. Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device won't affect the Apple iPhone 11 device. However, running this process on a CDMA device will result in a loss of cellular activities. Click "Unlock Now" to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you'll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click "Got It!" after agreeing with all the mentioned points.

- **Step 3. Jailbreaking and Activation Lock Bypass**

After this, if your iDevice isn't jailbroken, you will be required to jailbreak your device. For that, you can follow the step-by-step textual instructions or watch a video. Once the Apple iPhone 11 device is jailbroken, the process will commence automatically to bypass the Activation Lock. A completion message will pop up on the window when the process finishes. Afterward, tap the “Done” button to finalize the process successfully.

#### 2\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 15.0 to 16.3

- **Step 1. iCloud Activation Lock Removal Setup**

On accessing the “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” page, a notification will display on the screen, alerting the user about the ongoing process. Carefully review all the information provided and select the "I have read and agree to the agreement" option. Proceed by tapping on the "Got It!" choice.

- **Step 2. DFU Mode Initiation and Device Unlock**

Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the [DFU Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/dfu-mode/tools-for-iphone-to-enter-dfu-mode.html) for your iOS device. Once in the particular mode, the program will send an initial command to the Apple iPhone 11 device, prompting it to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed and repeat putting the iOS device in DFU Mode. Likewise, upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 11 device promptly. Finally, click the "Got It!" button to conclude the process.

![read agreement and agree](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-13.png)

- **Step 3. Completion of iCloud Activation Lock Removal**

After processing the Apple iPhone 11 device in DFU Mode, Dr.Fone initiates the iCloud Activation Lock removal process. Monitor the progress bar to witness the process's completion. Once finished, a completion message will appear on the screen. Click “Done” to finalize the removal of the iCloud Activation Lock.
