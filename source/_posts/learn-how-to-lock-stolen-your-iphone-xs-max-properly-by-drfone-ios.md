**Step** **3:** Now, it's time to scan your face with your Apple iPhone XS Max to initiate the setup. Again, you don't have to wear a mask at this stage, as the Apple iPhone XS Max device's main focus while scanning would be the eyes. Also, if you wear glasses, you can proceed without taking them off.

**Step 4:** After scanning your face twice, select "Add Glasses" by tapping on it. You can use your Face ID while wearing your regular glasses. Make sure that you scan your face with every pair of glasses daily.

After carefully following the steps mentioned above, you are ready to **unlock your Face ID with a mask**. Remember that Face ID will scan and focus mainly on your eyes and forehead. However, it cannot work in the scenarios if you have completely concealed your look by wearing hats or accessories that can hide your face.
