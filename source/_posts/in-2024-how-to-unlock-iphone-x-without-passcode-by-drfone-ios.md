## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone X without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone X without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone X passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

Follow the steps to do this.

1. First, connect your Apple iPhone X to your computer and launch iTunes. You will have to install it if you don't have it on your computer. For installation, [click here and download](https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes)
2. Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.
3. Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone X's specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named **Restore iPhone**.
4. By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone X, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone X XR lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone

If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven't used iTunes before, we have another solution. You can use the "Find My iPhone" feature to erase your device and unlock it. This is useful when you quickly want to unlock your Apple iPhone X without a passcode.

![using find my iphone to unlock iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-2.jpg)

All you have to do is follow the steps given below.

1. Log in to [the iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) website on your MacBook or Computer. For this, you will need to use your Apple ID and Password that you are using on your Apple iPhone X.
2. Once you are logged in to iCloud, you will see many options and features but look for the Find My iPhone option.
3. Once you find it, click on it, and you will see a few more options, and one of them would be **Erase iPhone**.
4. You will have to click on it, showing you a confirmation message to erase all your data on your Apple iPhone X.
5. Confirm it, and your Apple iPhone X will be restored to the factory settings, and all your data will be removed.
6. Once the process is completed, you can unlock your Apple iPhone X X lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #3: Remove Passcode With Tapping Erase Phone (iOS 15.2 only)

If both above-given methods don't work for you, or you don't have access to a computer or MacBook to use those methods, there is a 3rd method for you. But it only works on iPhones with iOS 15.2 versions.
