## Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID

Your iOS devices contain most of your digital data. That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.

You Want To Simplify Your Online Life

If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.

You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country

Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.

![apple id account information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-02.jpg)

## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 6 is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 6 is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.
