- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

**Step 4.** Click on the share button and Pick the Message choice.

**Step 5.** You don't need to text a message. Instead, add something arbitrary in the "To" field.

**Step 6.** Add Siri to make another contact by tapping on the new or + symbol. Siri will open the New Contact interface with details like adding the name, photo, etc.

**Step 7.** Add the photo from the photo library. Tap on "Add Photo," and it will open the library for you. Tap on Select Photo, and Siri will unlock the Apple iPhone 12 mini device and let you pick a photo.

**Step 8.** When the photo library is open, tap on the home button or return button to get back to the unlock screen to get to the Settings symbol.

**Step 9.** When you open your settings, you can now refresh your credentials. This might work by making a Face ID rather than a password to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini.

Besides, it works for iPhones with iOS 8.0 to 10.1. These bugs are fixed in the later versions of the Apple iPhone 12 mini and won't assist you with fooling Siri into unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 mini.
