## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access.

Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone X is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings
