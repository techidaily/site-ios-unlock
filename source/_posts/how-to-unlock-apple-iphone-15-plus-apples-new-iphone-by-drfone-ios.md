## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 15 Plus from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 15 Plus and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

### A. Reasons for Creating a New Apple ID Account

Here's a breakdown of the reasons why you should **create a new Apple ID for your Apple iPhone 15 Plus**:

- Your Apple ID is like your digital identity. Creating a new one lets you choose a unique email address that suits you, adding a personal touch to your Apple journey.
- Maybe you've been using an email for your Apple ID that you don't want to use anymore. Creating a new one helps keep your personal and Apple-related emails separate.
- **Switching Devices.**When you switch to a new Apple device, like getting a new iPhone or iPad, creating a unique Apple ID ensures a fresh start tailored to your new gadget.
- **Separation of Accounts.**Sometimes, you may want to keep your work-related apps and data separate from your ones. Creating a new Apple ID helps you achieve this separation.
- If you're using Apple services for different purposes, such as work and personal use, having separate Apple IDs can help keep everything organized and distinct.
