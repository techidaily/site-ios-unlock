So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 12 mini device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 12 mini, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 12 mini.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 12 mini and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 12 mini and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 12 mini was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 12 mini in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 12 mini and unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 12 mini

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 mini, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 12 mini:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 mini leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 12 mini itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 12 mini device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
