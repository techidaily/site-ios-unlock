## Part 4: How to get into a locked Apple iPhone SE with Siri?

If you don’t want to erase your device’s data while resolving this issue, you can use Siri. You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13).

**Step 1.** To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.

![share on message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492171595.jpg "share on message")

**Step 6.** A new interface will be opened from where you can draft a new message. Type anything in the “To” field and tap "return" from a keyboard.
