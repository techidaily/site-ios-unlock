## Part 7: How to Unlock iPhone Without a Passcode With the Finder or iTunes?

After looking at the maybe-trick way of the TikTok viral method and other unlock ways, an official solution from Apple, we also let you know how to fix the disabled iPhone. This method puts your phone into recovery mode with the help of iTunes or Finder on the computer. However, a small lousy side of this method is that it will erase your data along with the passcode.

- **Step 4:** Choose the Restore option when you see a pop-up. Your computer downloads software for your Apple iPhone XS Max and begins the restore process. If the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits the recovery mode screen, let the download finish, turn off your Apple iPhone XS Max, and start again.

**_Notice:_** _Before the Finder or iTunes restores your Apple iPhone XS Max, it will back up the Apple iPhone XS Max data in iCloud. Thus, you can download the restored files after the Apple iPhone XS Max device restarts._

Now, you have learned how to unlock a disabled iPhone with iTunes.

## Part 8: Try DFU Mode to Bypass iPhone Passcode

DFU mode (Device Firmware Update) is a special mode on an iPhone that allows you to install firmware or software updates. It can also be utilized to bypass the passcode on an iPhone. To use DFU mode to bypass the passcode on an iPhone, follow these steps:

- **Step 2.** Switch off your Apple iPhone XS Max and press and hold the Home and the Side/Power button for 10 seconds.
- **Step 3.** Release the Side/Power button, but continue to hold the Home button until iTunes recognizes your Apple iPhone XS Max in recovery mode.
- **Step 4.** When your iDevice is in recovery mode, you can use iTunes to restore your Apple iPhone XS Max and bypass the passcode.

Remember that using DFU mode to bypass your Apple iPhone XS Max passcode will erase all data from your device.
