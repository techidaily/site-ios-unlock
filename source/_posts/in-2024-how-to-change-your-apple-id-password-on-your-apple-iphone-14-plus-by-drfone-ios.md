## How To Change Your Apple ID Password On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus

Are you aware of the common mistakes people make when creating their Apple ID passwords, such as using weak passwords and personal information? And how often should you change your Apple ID password? If it's been a while since your last update, stay in this article to learn **how to change your Apple ID password on your account**.

![change apple id password on web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-03.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover **how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account**, here are three things you should consider:

- **Complexity**

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

- **Uniqueness**

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password. Read on to get to the heart of the matter – **how to change the password on Apple ID**. Doing it is easy; you can do it on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, iPad, Mac, or the web.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.

## Apple iPhone 14 Plus Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 14 Plus displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2.** Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.

![android ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3.** You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4.** Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17/14.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5.** Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.

It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and use it without a lock screen!

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 14 Plus in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary
