### Fix 11. Reset iPhone All Settings

Note that this action will reset all settings on your device, but it won't delete your data. Here's how to reset all settings to fix **iPhone swipe not working**:

**Step 1.** Go to your device's "General" settings and scroll down to tap the second last option, "Transfer or Reset iPhone." On the following screen, press "Reset" from the available two options.
