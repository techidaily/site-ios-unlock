## **Part 2. Unlock Locked iPhone 12 by Restoring it to Default Settings – iTunes**

iPhone users make sure that they connect and sync their devices with iTunes because their data is safe. iPhone users live without the fear of losing their data because it is backed up. Taking more advantage of this, iPhone users can restore their phone to default settings and can even unlock their iPhone without using a passcode.

Let us show you how to unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max without using a passcode;

1. Start the process by turning off your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.
2. After that, plug in your phone to the computer and open iTunes.
3. Once the phone is connected with iTunes, click on 'Summary' that will appear on the screen's left side.

6. As soon as that is done and iTunes has finished the process, your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max 12 will be restored to default settings.

## **Part 3. Unlock Disabled iPhone 12 by Erasing iPhone in iCloud**

IOS world is different from the Android world, and so, both have different and unique problems to deal with. For example, an android user can never imagine unlocking a disabled phone, but iPhone users surely know how to do it. It might be possible that someone doesn't know how they can erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from iCloud, so for such users, let's provide a step-by-step guideline;

1. Firstly, the user is requested to visit icloud.com on your computer or any other device that is in use. Then log in by using the Apple ID and password.

3. Once you are logged in, choose ‘Find iPhone’ and enter your Apple ID and password again.
4. 4\. Then, you are requested to click on ‘All Devices’ that will appear on the top of the browser and select your device's name from the list provided.
5. When you have selected your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, click on the ‘Erase iPhone’ button visible towards the screen's right side. This will erase all the data and settings from your device. It will also wipe the password.

### 2\. Using iTunes

**Cons:**

**Pros:**

1. The biggest benefit of using iCloud is that the user doesn't have to connect the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with the system. Just login is required for iCloud.
