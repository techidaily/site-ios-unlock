## Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country

**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

**Pros**

- **Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By **changing your App Store country**, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to **change your App Store country**.
- **Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. **Changing your App Store country** can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.
- **Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.

**Cons**

- **Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you've made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.
- **Offload Apps.**When you **change your App Store country**, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.
- **Family Sharing Issues.**If you're part of a Family Sharing group, **changing your App Store country** can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.

## Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and do the following:

(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.

(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.

(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 1: Visit _<https://icloud.com>_ and log in into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac

![find my on macos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus from the Apple iPhone 6 Plus devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus and return the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 6 Plus easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 6 Plus again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.
