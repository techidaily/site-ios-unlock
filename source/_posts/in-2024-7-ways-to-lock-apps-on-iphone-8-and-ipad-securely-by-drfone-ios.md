### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 8:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 8:

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone 8 backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

If you forget your password, you will be required to reset it before being able to access your backups again.

### iCloud and iTunes Backup Password

Resetting your password may be done in different methods, depending on whether or not you have an iCloud account. You may reset your iCloud password by visiting the iCloud website and following the steps. This requires that you already have an iCloud account.

Connecting your device to a computer and using the iTunes program will allow you to reset your password even if you do not have an iCloud account. After successfully changing your password, you can access your backups the same way as before.

![password security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/reset-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

To improve the safety of your Apple iPhone 8 backup, you should first change the password for your iTunes backup. This will guarantee that no one else can see your backup file and that only you can access it. No one else will have chance to get it.

### Basic Ways for Password Security

To reset your password, go to the **Preferences** menu in iTunes, and click on the **Reset Password** button. You will be prompted to enter your old password and a new one. Please choose a strong password that cannot be easily guessed.

Another way to enhance the security of your Apple iPhone 8 backup is to use iCloud instead of iTunes. iCloud offers an extra layer of security, as your backup file will be encrypted when transmitted to iCloud.

In addition, iCloud requires you to enter your Apple ID and password to access your backup file. This means that only you can access your backup and that it will be more difficult for someone else to gain access to it.

### 1\. Use birthday as password

It is essential to use a password that is both robust and one of a kind if you want to have the safety of the backup password for your Apple iPhone 8.

Using your birthdate as the password is one approach that has shown to be useful. This strategy helps guarantee that your password is not readily guessed or cracked while at the same time ensuring that it is simple for you to remember.

### 2\. Use a third-party app to keep it

There is a wide selection of third-party software on the market that may assist you in maintaining the privacy and integrity of the data stored on your Apple iPhone 8.

Launch Notes and make a new note to do this. After that, you may protect the message with a password and save it.

You may now easily access your backup password by referring to the note. Though it's not ideal, it's better than losing track of your password and starting over from scratch.
