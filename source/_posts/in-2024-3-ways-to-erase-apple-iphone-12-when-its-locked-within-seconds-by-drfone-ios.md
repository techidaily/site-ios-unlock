**Send a Custom Text Message:** When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.

**Erase Data Remotely:** Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 12 if you believe it's been some time since it's gone and you don't think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.

**Track Your Device on Map:** An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 12.

### 2\. Remove it from Find My in iCloud

One more method for unlocking the Lost Mode on your Apple iPhone 12 is to utilize the Find My iPhone application on the official iCloud site. Follow the steps underneath to do so:

1. Go to <www.icloud.com> and utilize your account details to sign in.
2. Click the "Find My iPhone" button and select all iDevices.

4. Click the "Stop Lost Mode" button to remove the lock from the phone.
5. Confirm this activity by clicking the "Stop Lost Mode" button again.

### 3\. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone's information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 12 device has an activation lock enabled.

The DNS bypass will send a fake "device isn't locked" message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 12 and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to **unlock lost iPhone**:

- Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 12, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.
- A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the "I" icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap "Forget this Network."

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-2.jpg)

- Tap on "Configure DNS," and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:

USA: 104.154.51.7

Asia: 104.155.28.90

Europe: 104.155.28.90

South America: 35.199.88.219

Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23

- Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network. Click the Back button when a popup says that the Apple iPhone 12 device is attempting to connect to the Apple servers.
- You will now be on the DNS bypass screen. Pick the applications from the list to keep using your device. However, only a handful of applications are available through this.

### 4\. Use Emergency Call

This technique is the most widely recognized one. You can bypass your iCloud activation by settling on a fake Emergency call. Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won't work for everyone.

If your Apple iPhone 12 is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your **iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:**

- Click the "Emergency Call" option on your locked device.

![emergency call](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg)

- Dial "\*#96274825\*0000\*1#," then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.
- If it's not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn't work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.
- Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again. Now create a new password after **iPhone Lost Mode unlock.**

### 5\. Apple iPhone Unlock

Apple iPhone Unlock is a site that can assist you with **iPhone in Lost Mode unlock**. You must give them your Apple iPhone 12's IMEI and model number to get their services.

The benefit of Apple iPhone Unlock is that they keep themselves updated with the latest technology. They are educated regarding their tool's advancement by giving updates every time.

## Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 12

For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.

Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 13/12/11 and set it again if you have put on some 'COVID weight' owing to working from home.

Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 12 device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 12 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 12 device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 12 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode.

Step 2: Scroll and tap the option "Reset Face ID" to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 13/12/11.

## Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 12

Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.

Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 12 in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.

Step 5: When done, tap Done.

In case you are getting the following error:

![face id error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg)

There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone 12 13/12/11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.

If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone 12 device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone 12 (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone 12 can be used solely with passcodes if you want. If you find that your screen is locked and you can‘t unlock it, you can always find help in tools such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS). So go ahead, use the new Face ID on your Apple iPhone 12 with confidence, and enjoy a more secure experience on your new iPhone than ever before.
