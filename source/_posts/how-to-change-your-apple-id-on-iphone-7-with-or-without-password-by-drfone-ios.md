### Method 5: Unlock iPhone via Erase iPhone Features (iOS 15.2)

With iOS 15.2, Apple introduced the Erase iPhone feature, aiding users in resetting devices with forgotten passcodes. The functionality applies to iPhones connected to the network with a broken Home button. Compatible devices include iPhone 6 series, iPhone SE series, and newer models. However, it comes at the cost of erasing all content and data on the Apple iPhone 7 device. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1**: Power on your Apple iPhone 7 by tapping the Power button, then enter the wrong passcode multiple times until the **Erase iPhone** button appears at the bottom right corner of the screen.

![erase iphone process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-iphone-without-home-button-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Tap the **Erase iPhone** button and input your Apple ID passcode to initiate the process. Once the Apple logo displays on your Apple iPhone 7 screen, you can now access your device without the need for a passcode.

**_**_Note_**__**_：_**_****Keep in mind that all previous content and data on the phone will be erased during this operation.**

### Method 6: Unlock iPhone via iTunes/Finder

For Mac or Windows users, both Finder and iTunes can **unlock your Apple iPhone 7 without the Home button**. Windows or Mac Mojave users are recommended to use iTunes. Mac Catalina and newer users should use Finder. Before using iTunes or Finder, it's advisable to back up your Apple iPhone 7 on iCloud. Here's how to proceed:

- **Step 1:** Put your Apple iPhone 7 in the recovery mode and connect it to the computer. Launch Finder or iTunes for Windows or Mac Mojave users.

![itunes finder iphone recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-iphone-without-home-button-12.jpg)

- **Step 2**: A window in Finder will prompt you to choose between restoring or updating; click **Restore**. Confirm your action by tapping **Restore** again. Upon completion, your Apple iPhone 7 will be unlocked without the Home button.

### Method 7: Unlock iPhone via iCloud

If none of the methods work or Dr.Fone is unavailable to you for some reason, then you can use iCloud. To **unlock your Apple iPhone 7 without the Home button**, visit iCloud.com and sign in with your Apple ID. Next, go to **Find My iPhone**, select your device, and choose **Erase iPhone** to unlock it remotely.

## Part 2. What To Do if Your Home Button Is Broken

When faced with a broken iPhone Home button, several quick fixes and solutions can sometimes help. Here are some effective measures before considering professional assistance:

![broken iphone home button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-iphone-without-home-button-14.jpg)

**Recalibrate the Home Button**

Go to **Settings** > **General** > **Accessibility** and toggle the **Bold Text** switch. Restart your Apple iPhone 7, and this may recalibrate the Home button.

**Restore iPhone Firmware**

In extreme cases, restoring the [<u>iPhone firmware</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html) can resolve Home button issues. Tools like Dr.Fone offer a comprehensive solution to restore firmware and address various lock screen challenges.

**Clean the Home Button**

Dust and debris can affect the Home button's functionality. Gently clean the area around the button using a small, soft brush or compressed air.

**Use the Charger to Press Against the Home Button**

This unconventional method involves using the charging cable to apply gentle pressure on the Home button. Be cautious to avoid excessive force.

**Visit the Apple Store if Covered by a Warranty**

If your Apple iPhone 7 is still under warranty, visiting an Apple Store is advisable. Apple's warranty covers hardware issues, including malfunctioning Home buttons.

## Conclusion

A broken iPhone Home button need not spell disaster. Embrace the solutions discussed and try the best solution available. Enable AssistiveTouch, recalibrate the Home button, clean the area, or even visit an Apple Store if under warranty.

For a comprehensive fix, consider Dr.Fone Screen - Unlock iOS if data loss is a concern. The tool can easily handle unlocking an iPhone without a functioning Home button.
