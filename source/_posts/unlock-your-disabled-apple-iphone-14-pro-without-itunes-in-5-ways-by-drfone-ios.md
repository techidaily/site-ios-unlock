Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 14 Pro with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 14 Pro, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and click Erase iPhone and confirm.
