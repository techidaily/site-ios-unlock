Before choosing "Remove Now," please read the 3 notes carefully:

- Verify that "Find My iPhone" is disabled.
- Do not launch "iTunes" at this time.
- Your device will reboot in the process of deleting

Dr.Fone can automatically verify your iTunes backup and erase it. Once the progress indicator reaches 100 percent, this encryption will be removed. This procedure will not need much time.

**Step 5:** The iTunes backup encryption now disappears! You may use your Apple iPhone 13 mini freely.
