## Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode

Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we'll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.

### 1\. Use Find My iPhone

If you've activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn't require any technical knowledge or special tools.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Just follow the steps below and get started.

- **Step 1:** Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com/find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.
- **Step 2:** Select "All Devices" at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 15 from the list of devices.
- **Step 3:** Click "Erase iPhone" and confirm that you want to erase your device.

Once your Apple iPhone 15 has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.

### 2\. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes

You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you've synced your Apple iPhone 15 with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 15, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.

![with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg)

Just go with the steps below.

- **Step 1:** To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 15 to a computer and turn on iTunes.
- **Step 2:** While your Apple iPhone 15 is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.
- **Step 3:** When the "Restore" or "Update" appears, please choose "Restore".

iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it's finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.

### 3\. Use Siri

If you're running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn't work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it's not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.

Just follow the instructions.

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"
- **Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock".
- **Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

While this method doesn't give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device's features.

## Forgot Apple iPhone 15 Backup Password? Here's What to Do

Forgetting your Apple iPhone 15 backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can't access your data, but it also means you can't restore your phone if something goes wrong.

There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 15 backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you're having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 15 backup password, don't despair. There are still ways to get it back!

![forget backup password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 15 is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 15 to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 15 device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

### 1\. Try all passwords you used on your Apple iPhone 15

The typical method that each individual attempts for the first time is to input all of the available passcodes. Even if it is the most straightforward technique, there is still a possibility that you miss one of them. Therefore, think about all of the passwords you may input, which are listed below.

- The password to log in to the computer
- The password to access Apple ID
- The password to access the encrypted data on the hard disk
- The password to access various websites
- The password to log in to the computer
- Password for the wireless network
- Password for the email account
- Passcode for the administrator
- Passcode for the iPhone

### 2\. "Reset All Settings" via "Settings"

To begin, go to the **Settings** app on your iOS device, then choose **General**, followed by **Reset.**

![reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-3.jpg)

You may now go to **Reset All Settings** and confirm by entering the security passcode when prompted. Then, your phone will automatically go through the process of resetting and returning to its default settings.

You can also get rid of the password for the last backup without deleting any other apps or data.

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 15 to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 15 will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 15.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!

## How To Change Your Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 With or Without Password

The Apple ID is a unique identifier used to log in to all Apple services, including iCloud, the App Store, Apple Music, and more. You can track purchases and manage your account settings through your Apple ID. But what if you need a new one for security or moving to a new location?

Whatever the reason, learning **how to change your Apple ID on your iPad** is straightforward. And this guide will show the steps and provide some tips at the end.

## Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID

Your iOS devices contain most of your digital data. That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.

If you feel the existing Apple ID isn't secure enough, it's a good idea to **change your Apple ID on your iPad** or other devices. Aside from this, there are a few scenarios where you might find yourself needing to change your details:

You No Longer Use the Email Address or Phone Number Associated With Your Apple ID

Life moves fast, and sometimes contact info changes. If the email or phone number linked to your Apple ID becomes outdated, it's a good idea to update it. That way, you won't miss out on vital notifications or have trouble recovering your account if needed.

You Want To Simplify Your Online Life

If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.

You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country

Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.

![apple id account information](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-02.jpg)

Changing your Apple ID can be smart, ensuring your digital life stays up-to-date, secure, and tailored to your needs. It's not complicated, and it's all about making your Apple experience better suited to you. So, go ahead and learn **how to change your Apple ID on your iPad** in the following sections.

## Part 3: What To Do if You Cannot Change Your Apple ID on iPad?

**Changing your Apple ID on an iPad** is usually easy. However, there can be setbacks during the process. Now, here's what to do if you find yourself unable to do it and why it might be happening:

Try Again Later

If you encounter errors during the process, give it a little time and try again. Mayne it is because you **changed your Apple ID on your iPad** to an iCloud email address within 30 days.

![change apple id to icloud email](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-07.jpg)

Check if Apple ID Is Already in Use

Apple IDs are unique, and you can't have two identical ones. If you're trying to change your Apple ID to one that's already in use, you'll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn't already taken. Remove it from the family member's account if they are using it.

Your Apple ID Is an Email Address

If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won't be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.

If you've addressed these issues and still can't change your Apple ID, don't worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges. Contact them for guidance and solutions tailored to your situation.

However, if you can't **change your Apple ID on your iPad** because you forgot or don't have access to the password, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone. This tool is easy to use and can help you unlock your iPad and remove the Apple ID in a few clicks.

Before you **change your Apple ID on your iPad**, create a [<u>backup of your data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup/backup-iphone-with-broken-screen.html) so you don't lose important files. You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.

Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you're getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.

- **Password Check**

Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.

- **Avoid Sharing an Apple ID**

It's best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It's simple and highly effective.
