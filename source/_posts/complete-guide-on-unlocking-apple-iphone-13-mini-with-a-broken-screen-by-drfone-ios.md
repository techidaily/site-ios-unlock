### 3. Reset Your Face ID

In some instances, it’s the Face ID feature that’s causing trouble, so you might want to try and reset it. It’s much easier than it may sound, you just need to follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s **Settings**;
- **Step 2:** Select **Face ID & Passcode**;
- **Step 3:** Tap **Reset Face ID**.

When you tap on this, you’ll need to go through the process of setting your Face ID as usual. You’ll need to type in your passcode, hold your Apple iPhone 13 mini in front of you (in portrait orientation), tap to get started, and put your face in the provided frame.

Move your face to complete the circle, then tap on **Continue**. Repeat the face scan process the second time and select **Done**.

### 4. Do a System Repair on Your Apple iPhone 13 mini

If your Apple Watch unlock is still misbehaving, you might need to do a full system repair. As a general rule of thumb, it’s best to use verified apps like Dr.Fone to prevent the problem from getting worse.

[<u>Dr.Fone Apple iPhone 13 mini system repair</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/ios-system-recovery.html) is designed to be fast, efficient, and safe. It can repair virtually any system glitch in less than five minutes, ensuring your phone operates seamlessly.

To perform a standard system repair with Dr.Fone, follow the next few steps:

- **Step 1:** Download and launch Dr.Fone on your computer;
- **Step 2:** From the **Toolbox**on your left-hand side, select **System Repair**;

- **Step 3:** Connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to your PC using a cable connection;
- **Step 4:** Select your device type in the new window that opens;
- **Step 5:** Select **iOS repair**;

![dr.fone ios repair](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/ios-system-repair-1.png)

- **Step 6:** Select **Standard Repair Mode**;
- **Step 7:** Follow the on-screen instructions and select **Enter Recovery Mode**;
- (Alternatively, select **Guide**if your phone is unresponsive);
- **Step 8:** Select the iOS firmware you want to download and install on your device;
- **Step 9:** Wait for the download to finish, then select **Repair Now**;
- **Step 10:** Wait until the process is complete, then select **Done**.

If it was a system mistake preventing you from unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 mini with your Apple Watch, the option should be functioning well after the Dr.Fone iOS repair.

### 5. Reset Network Settings

If the problem wasn’t due to a system glitch, you should try resetting your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s network settings. The process is simple, just:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network**;
- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode.

Resetting your network settings will clear out data from your internet, local network, and devices, including WiFi passwords, some Bluetooth connections, and more. However, your paired devices, such as the Apple Watch, shouldn’t be removed.

### 6. Reset Your Watch and Pair It Again

Finally, if you’re still experiencing issues, you might need to reset your Apple Watch and pair it with your Apple iPhone 13 mini again.

It’s all quite simple:

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the power button;
- **Step 2:** Drag the slider under **Power off**to the right;
- **Step 3:** Press and hold the power button to turn the Apple iPhone 13 mini device back on.

To perform a hard reset, simultaneously press and hold the power button and digital crown.

## Conclusion

Using your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 mini is convenient when you cannot use the Face ID feature. It allows you to seamlessly unlock your phone when wearing sunglasses, goggles, face masks, or other face coverings that prevent the Face ID from working.

Enabling this option is a straightforward process, and if there’s ever a glitch, there are several options you could try to repair it.
