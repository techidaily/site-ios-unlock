To combat hackers including GrayKey and protect iOS users' data security, the USB Restricted Mode feature arrived with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018 and be improved in iOS12.

## Part 2: How to Disable USB Restricted Mode?

- **Step 1:** Open **Settings** on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.
- **Step 2:** Click on **Face ID & Passcode** (or **Touch ID & Passcode**), and then input your screen passcode.
- **Step 3:** Scroll to the bottom of the page and find "**USB accessories**" in the "**Allow access when locked**" column.
- **Step 4:** Click **the toggle button on the right** to disable this feature.

After completing all the steps, your Apple iPhone 12 Pro can connect USB accessories anytime, anywhere. However, it is very common to forget to unlock the passcode. Next, we will recommend four solutions to help you use USB accessories without a passcode.
