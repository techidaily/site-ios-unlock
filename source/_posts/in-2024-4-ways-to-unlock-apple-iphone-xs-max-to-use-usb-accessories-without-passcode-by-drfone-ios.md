## Part 1: iPhone Backup Encryption Specifications

A safety precaution that may be taken to prevent unwanted access to your Apple iPhone XS Max backups is using a password for the backups themselves.

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone XS Max lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone XS Max mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone XS Max models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone XS Max models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone XS Max mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone XS Max 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone XS Max is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone XS Max. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone XS Max and unlocking it.
