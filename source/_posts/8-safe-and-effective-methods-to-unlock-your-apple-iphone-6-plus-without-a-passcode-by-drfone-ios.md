## Part 3: Tips for Successful Apple iPhone 6 Plus Unlocking

Unlocking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus can be a delicate process. To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:

### 1\. Check Device Eligibility

Make sure your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.

### 2\. Backup Your Data

Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.

If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.

### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 6 Plus's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.

Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn't been unlocked during this time.

When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to the computer.

## Conclusion

To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus can be daunting when you've forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues. Thankfully, there are different methods available to regain access to your device. This article explored three methods: using iCloud's Find My iPhone, restoring with iTunes, and utilizing Dr.Fone.
