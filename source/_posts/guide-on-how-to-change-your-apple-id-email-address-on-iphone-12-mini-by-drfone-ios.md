## Forgot Apple iPhone 12 mini Backup Password? Here's What to Do

Forgetting your Apple iPhone 12 mini backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can't access your data, but it also means you can't restore your phone if something goes wrong.

There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 12 mini backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you're having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 12 mini backup password, don't despair. There are still ways to get it back!

![forget backup password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 12 mini is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 12 mini to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 12 mini device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password

### 1\. Try all passwords you used on your Apple iPhone 12 mini

The typical method that each individual attempts for the first time is to input all of the available passcodes. Even if it is the most straightforward technique, there is still a possibility that you miss one of them. Therefore, think about all of the passwords you may input, which are listed below.

- The password to log in to the computer
- The password to access Apple ID
- The password to access the encrypted data on the hard disk
- The password to access various websites
- The password to log in to the computer
- Password for the wireless network
- Password for the email account
- Passcode for the administrator
- Passcode for the iPhone

### 2\. "Reset All Settings" via "Settings"

To begin, go to the **Settings** app on your iOS device, then choose **General**, followed by **Reset.**

![reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-3.jpg)

You may now go to **Reset All Settings** and confirm by entering the security passcode when prompted. Then, your phone will automatically go through the process of resetting and returning to its default settings.

You can also get rid of the password for the last backup without deleting any other apps or data.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-4.jpg)

Use a USB cable to link your Apple iPhone 12 mini to your PC. Look at the small iOS icon in the figure below. Just click on it.

![backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-5.jpg)

Proceed to the **Summary Page** and make your selection there for **The Computer.** After selecting **Encrypt Local Backup**, you must create a new password. After you have pressed the **Backup Now** option, wait for iTunes to create a new password for you.

### 3\. Find your password in the macOS keychain

**Step 1:** Launch Keychain Access by going to **Application** \> **Utilities** \> **Keychain Access** once your Mac has booted up.

**Step 2:** Check for a backup of your Apple iPhone 12 mini by entering it into the search box and looking for it there.

**Step 3:** Double-click the **Show Password** option, and then choose it from the drop-down menu. After that, type in the password for the keychain. At long last, the password for your Apple iPhone 12 mini backup will be shown.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-6.jpg)

### 4\. Select "Back Up Now" via iCloud to remove password

If you already have a backup stored in iCloud, you may use iCloud for recovery.

First, power up the gadget and look for the "Hello" screen. If you have previously set up your Apple iPhone 12 mini, you must delete or remove all of the material before continuing.

Navigate to the **Apps & Data menu** and choose the **Restore from iCloud Backup** option.

After successfully signing in with your Apple ID, choose **Backup**.

![restore from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-7.jpg)

During the time that the system is being restored, it is essential that the Wi-Fi connection remains active.

### 5\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

With Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, it's easy to follow all the steps to get rid of the iTunes backup password.

**Step 1:** After installing Dr.Fone, open it and look for the red **Screen Unlock** button.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2:** In the Screen Unlock interface, tap **Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption** in the bottom right corner to move forward.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3:** When you get to this page, use a USB cable to connect your iOS device to the PC. If Dr.Fone can find this connection, you will see the picture below.

Before you click **Remove Now**, please carefully read the following three notes:

- Make sure to turn off **Find My iPhone**.
- Don't open iTunes while doing this.
- Your device will reboot

![connected](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

**Step 4:** Dr.Fone can check your iTunes backup and delete it by itself. This encryption will be erased when the progress bar reaches 100%. This will take a short time to do.

![checking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png)

**Step 5:** The encryption on the iTunes backup has been removed successfully! Now you can easily back up, restore, move, or wipe your device.

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 12 mini to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 12 mini will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 12 mini.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesn't Work

![man wearing apple watch with Apple iPhone 12 mini by him](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch.jpg)

There are plenty of reasons why Apple devices are in such high demand. The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 12 mini’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.

However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.

With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 12 mini’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.

Moreover, you might be able to **use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini**.

Now, you cannot just **unlock any Apple iPhone 12 mini with your Watch**. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Here’s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.


## Part 1. Can I Use an Apple Watch To Unlock My Apple iPhone 12 mini?

![phone, earphones, and apple watch on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-2.jpg)

The Apple iPhone 12 mini face ID is one of the simplest, most practical ways to unlock your phone. While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.

With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.

The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.

What could work is your Apple Watch.

Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 12 mini model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. It’s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.

## Part 2. Requirements for Unlocking Apple iPhone 12 mini With Apple Watch

![unlock requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-3.jpg)

Unfortunately, not every Apple iPhone 12 mini can be unlocked with your Apple Watch, and not every Apple Watch can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini. Both devices must meet some requirements before you can adjust your settings to enable this option.

To be able to use your Apple Watch to unlock your phone with the utmost ease, you’ll need:

- An Apple iPhone 12 mini with Face ID – Apple iPhone 12 mini X and newer models;
- iOS 14.5 and newer versions;
- An Apple Watch series 3 and newer models;
- watchOS 7.4 and newer versions.

Additional requirements you’ll need to meet include:

- Your Apple iPhone 12 mini and Apple Watch need to be paired;
- Both devices need to have WiFi and Bluetooth turned on (but a connection to a WiFi network isn’t necessary);
- You need to have a passcode on your Apple Watch;
- Wrist detection on your watch needs to be turned on;
- The watch needs to be on your wrist and unlocked.

You’ll also need to wear items such as sunglasses, face coverings, ski masks, or others that prevent you from using your Apple iPhone 12 mini Face ID.

## Part 3. How To Unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini With an Apple Watch

![a cyclist wearing an apple watch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-4.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode;
- **Step 3:** Find and enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**.

Remember that your Apple Watch’s wrist detection must be turned on for this option to work. When you tap to enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**, if your wrist detection isn’t turned on, you’ll get a prompt on your phone asking you to turn it on.

You can turn on wrist detection on your watch by following these steps:

- **Step 4:** Go to **Settings**on your Apple Watch;
- **Step 5:** Tap on the **Passcode**;
- **Step 6:** Toggle **Wrist Detection**

![apple watch wrist detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-6.jpg)

Now that you’ve enabled the option to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini using your Apple Watch, it’s time to simply start using the feature. To unlock your phone, you’ll need to:

- Have your Apple Watch on your wrist, unlocked;
- Tap on your Apple iPhone 12 mini or raise it to your face to activate it;
- Glance at your phone while wearing a face mask, sunglasses, or another item that’s preventing you from using Face ID;
- Swipe up on your phone’s screen.

Your Apple Watch will send an alert when you’ve used it to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini. If you accidentally unlock your phone, simply tap on the **Lock Apple iPhone 12 mini** on the screen of your watch to lock it.

However, remember that the next time you want to use your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini, you’ll first need to type in your passcode.

- Feature **Unlock with Apple Watch**turned on on your Apple iPhone 12 mini.

If all the settings are correct, try one of the following options.

### 2. Restart Your WiFi/Bluetooth Connection

Your Apple iPhone 12 mini and your Apple Watch need to have both WiFi and Bluetooth turned on. If they’re turned on on both devices, try turning them off and back on again to restart the connection.

Remember, you only need WiFi and Bluetooth on but don’t need to be connected to a WiFi network.

If the problem persists, you could also restart your devices and try again.

### 3. Reset Your Face ID

In some instances, it’s the Face ID feature that’s causing trouble, so you might want to try and reset it. It’s much easier than it may sound, you just need to follow the next few steps:
