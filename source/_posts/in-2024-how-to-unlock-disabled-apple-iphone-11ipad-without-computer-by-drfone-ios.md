## Part 3: How to Unlock iPhone with Siri If its Screen is broken

Siri is a voice assistant on Apple devices. Like other devices have Alexa and Google Assistant, iPhone has Siri. It empowers you to use the Apple iPhone 11 through voice commands. You can converse with Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 password.

How might Siri unlock iPhone? One can use bugs in Siri to unlock iPhone. However, it is only possible in a few iOS versions.

**Step 1.** First and foremost, enable Siri. You should hold the home button of your locked iPhone and say 'Hello Siri' to enact her.

You need to ask Siri, "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, what time is it in the USA"? That will permit Siri to open the World Clock on your home screen.

**Step 2.** Presently, tap on the world clock symbol. Now, tap on the + sign in the upper right corner to add the clock feature to the home screen.

**Step 3.** At the point when another clock is added, you will have the choice to share the new clock.

**Step 4.** Click on the share button and Pick the Message choice.

**Step 5.** You don't need to text a message. Instead, add something arbitrary in the "To" field.

**Step 6.** Add Siri to make another contact by tapping on the new or + symbol. Siri will open the New Contact interface with details like adding the name, photo, etc.

**Step 7.** Add the photo from the photo library. Tap on "Add Photo," and it will open the library for you. Tap on Select Photo, and Siri will unlock the Apple iPhone 11 device and let you pick a photo.

**Step 8.** When the photo library is open, tap on the home button or return button to get back to the unlock screen to get to the Settings symbol.

**Step 9.** When you open your settings, you can now refresh your credentials. This might work by making a Face ID rather than a password to unlock your Apple iPhone 11.

Besides, it works for iPhones with iOS 8.0 to 10.1. These bugs are fixed in the later versions of the Apple iPhone 11 and won't assist you with fooling Siri into unlocking your Apple iPhone 11.
