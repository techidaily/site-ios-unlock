## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 6 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 6 is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 6 Locked?

In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 6 does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.
