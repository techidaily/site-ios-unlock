## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover **how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account**, here are three things you should consider:

- **Complexity**

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

- **Uniqueness**

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password. Read on to get to the heart of the matter – **how to change the password on Apple ID**. Doing it is easy; you can do it on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, iPad, Mac, or the web.

Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.

![attention aware features](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-6.jpg)

Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and passcode.

Step 2: Toggle Require Attention For Face ID On.

Step 3: Toggle Attention Aware Features On.

That‘s it. Now, when you get a call and your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13 is ringing loud, looking at your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11 will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Additionally, your Apple iPhone 6 Plus screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.

### II.IV Filling Passwords in Safari Automatically Using Face ID

Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus with Face ID.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.

Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.

Step 3: Look at your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### II.V Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

## Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 6 Plus

To restart your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13/12/11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.
