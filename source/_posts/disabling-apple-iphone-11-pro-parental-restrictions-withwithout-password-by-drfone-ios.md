## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 11 Pro

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 11 Pro:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 11 Pro itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
