## Part 1: 4 Simple Ways to Unlock iPhone without Pin

The steps below work if your Apple iPhone 11 or iPad runs iOS 15.2 or later and is connected to the internet. Here's what you need to do when you **forgot iPhone PIN**:

- Please enter your password a few times from your device's Lock Screen until it requests that you attempt another time. Then repeat this activity until you see the Erase iPhone choice in the corner of the screen.
- Tap Erase iPhone, then click again to confirm your activity.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-1.jpg)

- Tap Erase iPhone back to erase all your user data and settings for all time.
- At the point when the iOS device restarts, adhere to the on-screen directions. Set your phone once more, and restore your data and settings from a backup. Now set a new password for your device.

**Instructions to Restore a Locked iPhone Running iOS 15.1 or Prior**

- To begin with, put your Apple iPhone 11 into DFU recovery mode.
- Then, connect it to a PC or Macintosh through a Lightning link.
- Select your Apple iPhone 11 in the Finder sidebar on Mac or iTunes on the PC.
- Pick Restore when you see the choice to Restore. Let the download finish if the download takes over 15 minutes and your device leaves the recovery mode screen. Then, at that point, turn off your Apple iPhone 11 and start once more.

![click restore](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-2.jpg)

- Disconnect your Apple iPhone 11, then, at that point, turn it on and set it up. That's all you need to do.

### 2\. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud

Apple allows clients to erase iPhone data to safeguard it from others remotely. However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don't erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 11 will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

To unlock iPhone through iCloud:

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.

**Step 2.** Click the "Find iPhone" option from the different choices available.

**Step 3.** Click "All Devices" and pick the Apple iPhone 11 device you need to unlock.

**Step 4.** Click the "Erase iPhone" button. Subsequently, set up the Apple iPhone 11 device and set another lock screen PIN. With iCloud, you can unlock your iDevice without even touching your device.

![icloud unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-3.jpg)

### 3\. Unlock it with iTunes

Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 11 in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone 11 device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone 11. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.

Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.

Additionally, ensure that you keep your iDevices' Apple ID details safe. Else, you will not have the option to use the iDevice again. Using iTunes will erase the screen's password but not the firmware. Considering that, you must keep the information in mind to set up and utilize the Apple iPhone 11 device.

To sidestep iPhone password with iTunes:

**Step 1. Go to Recovery mode**

**On iPhone 8/8 Or more and Above:** Hold the power/side button and press any of the volume buttons until a slider appears. Move the slider to turn off the Apple iPhone 11 device. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 11 device shows the recovery mode screen.
