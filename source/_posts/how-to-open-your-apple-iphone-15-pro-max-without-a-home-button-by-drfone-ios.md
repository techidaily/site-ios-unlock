![incorrect password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-unlocker-3.jpg)

An iPhone backup unlocker is software that, if you forget the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, may assist you in regaining access to your device.

A brute-force assault is the most popular strategy for accomplishing this goal, while many other approaches may also work. To do this, one must iterate through every conceivable combination of letters and digits until one reaches the proper passcode.

If the password for an iPhone has been forgotten, this is often the only option to recover access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, even though it may be time-consuming.

We are fortunate to have access to a wide variety of software applications that, when used together, may significantly streamline and simplify the process. So, let's talk about them!
