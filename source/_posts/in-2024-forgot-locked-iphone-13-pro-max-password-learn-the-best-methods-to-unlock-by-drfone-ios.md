## Part 5. What To Do When iCloud Activation Lock Active?

Although IMEI Unlocking turns out to be quite an exceptional service, it generally is not the only thing that becomes a barrier for iPhone users. The iCloud Activation binds an Apple device to a user's Apple ID, making itself a great security measure. It presents a unique circumstance where services such as **doctorSIM legit** are inapplicable. [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) specializes in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock.

It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions. Once the activation lock is removed, it grants full access to users' devices. Dr.Fone also extends its capabilities to remove an Apple ID in cases where the password is forgotten. Its remarkable performance includes the permanent bypass of the Apple ID lock.

### Notable Characteristics of Wondershare Dr.Fone

2. Wondershare Dr.Fone specializes in bypassing various screen locks, including passcodes and Face IDs.
3. Fone can remove the iTunes backup encryption lock without any impact on your data.

### Steps To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock via Wondershare Dr.Fone

Dr.Fone is intended for users locked out of their devices. Given below are the steps you need to follow when using Dr.Fone to bypass iCloud Activation Lock:

#### 1\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1

Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the "Toolbox" tab, navigate to "Screen Unlock" and select "iOS."

- **Step 2. Device Identification and Unlock Initiation**

Now, decide whether your device is GSM or CDMA, as it is an important aspect. Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device won't affect the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device. However, running this process on a CDMA device will result in a loss of cellular activities. Click "Unlock Now" to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you'll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click "Got It!" after agreeing with all the mentioned points.

Once the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is jailbroken, the process will commence automatically to bypass the Activation Lock. A completion message will pop up on the window when the process finishes. Afterward, tap the “Done” button to finalize the process successfully.

- **Step 2. DFU Mode Initiation and Device Unlock**

Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the [DFU Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/dfu-mode/tools-for-iphone-to-enter-dfu-mode.html) for your iOS device. Once in the particular mode, the program will send an initial command to the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device, prompting it to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed and repeat putting the iOS device in DFU Mode. Likewise, upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device promptly.
