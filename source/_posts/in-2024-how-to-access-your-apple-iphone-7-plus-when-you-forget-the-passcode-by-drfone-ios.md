- **Step 2.** Switch off your Apple iPhone 7 Plus and press and hold the Home and the Side/Power button for 10 seconds.
- **Step 3.** Release the Side/Power button, but continue to hold the Home button until iTunes recognizes your Apple iPhone 7 Plus in recovery mode.
- **Step 4.** When your iDevice is in recovery mode, you can use iTunes to restore your Apple iPhone 7 Plus and bypass the passcode.

Remember that using DFU mode to bypass your Apple iPhone 7 Plus passcode will erase all data from your device.
