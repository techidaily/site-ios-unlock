### 1\. Network Freedom

One of the standout advantages of an unlocked iPhone 15 is the freedom to choose any carrier. Users can easily switch between carriers. It allows them to select the one that offers the best coverage, pricing, and customer service. Thus, avoiding being restricted to a particular carrier's offerings.

### 2\. Global Accessibility

Unlocked iPhones are a traveler's dream. With an unlocked device, you can insert a local SIM card when abroad. It lets you sidestep the exorbitant international roaming charges. This feature allows you to maintain connectivity without constraints. This makes it an ideal companion for international adventurers.

Unlocked iPhones have a higher resale value than their locked counterparts. The broader appeal and flexibility of an unlocked device make it an attractive option. It is true for most potential buyers in the second-hand market.

Unlocked iPhone 15 Series presents a world of advantages. However, it's essential to approach any decision with a balanced perspective. Given below are the potential drawbacks associated with purchasing an **iPhone 15 Pro unlocked**:

If the new Apple iPhone 7 Plus is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 7 Plus from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 7 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 7 Plus 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus 13/12/11.
