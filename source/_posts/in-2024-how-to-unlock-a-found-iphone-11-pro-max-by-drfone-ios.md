### 3.2 Apple iCloud Feature

iCloud is a multifunctional drive compatible with iOS and macOS. It saves your data, your media and organizes your files in folders. Moreover, it allows the user to share media, data, files, and even location with the other iPhone/iOS user. The major feature of Apple iCloud is its ‘Backup’ which stores all your data in case you lose or damage your phone.

To fix the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max passcode, which is not working, iCloud can come in handy. But this method can only work if you've logged in to your iCloud account on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and your "Find My iPhone" application is turned on. All you have to do is erase your data which will automatically erase your passcode through iCloud.

**Step 1: Sign in with Apple ID**

First, open iCloud.com on another iOS and write your credentials to sign in your Apple ID.

**Step 2: Select your Device**

Click on "Find My iPhone" and select "All devices," and a list of devices will come up which are working under the same Apple ID. Select your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.

**Step 3: Erase Data and Set up your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.**

Now click on the option of “Erase iPhone” to erase all your data and even your passcode. You have the autonomy to set up your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max from a previous backup or set it up as a new device.
