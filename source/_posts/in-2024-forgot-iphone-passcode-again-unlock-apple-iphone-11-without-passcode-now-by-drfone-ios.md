Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 11 without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 11 to your computer via cable and wait for your computer to detect your device.

**Step 2:** As soon as your Apple iPhone 11 is detected, open iTunes and force restart your phone to activate the Recovery Mode. Activating this mode is different for different models of iPhone.

- For iPhone 8 and the later: Press the Volume Down button and release is immediately. Then press the Volume Up button and release it immediately again. After that, press and hold the Power Button until you see the Apple logo.
- For iPhone 7 and 7+: Press the Power Button and Volume Down button at the same time and hold them until the Apple logo appears on your screen.
- For iPhone 6s, and Previous Models: Press and hold the Home Button and Power button concurrently until your Apple iPhone 11 shows the Apple logo.

Once your Apple iPhone 11 shows the Apple logo, it means the Recovery Mode is activated.
