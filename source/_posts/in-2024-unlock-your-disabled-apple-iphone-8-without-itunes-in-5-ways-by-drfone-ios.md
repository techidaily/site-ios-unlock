## 3 Simple Methods to Factory Reset Locked iPhone

Besides the above-given method, other methods can also help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes.

These methods are as follows:

### Method #1: Factory reset via the Find My feature on your device

Resetting your locked iPhone without iTunes is one of the most effective methods. You can use this method if you have set up the " Find My iPhone " function on your device.

**Step 3:** Choose the Apple iPhone 8 device you wish to erase and click "Erase iPhone."

**Step 4:** Enter your Apple ID password when prompted, and click the " Erase " button to proceed.

Now that your device has been erased, you can reset it as a new one.

### Method #2: Use the Find My feature via another device to remotely factory reset your device (your apple id, password, and Internet required)

This is another method you can use if you have the " Find My iPhone " feature on your device. You can use this method to remotely factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes by using another iOS device.

Your device will now be erased, and you can set it up as a new device.

### Method #3: Enter the Recovery Mode of the Finder

If you want to factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes and any data loss, then this is the method you should use. This method will put your device into recovery mode, and then you can restore it from a previous backup.

## FAQs

### 1\. Can a Factory Reset Bypass the Lock screen Passcode on iPhone?

Yes. A factory reset will bypass the lock screen passcode on your Apple iPhone 8 and allow you to access it without a passcode. However, all your data will disappear, so make sure you have a backup.

### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone 8 set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone 8 to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:

![hard reset iphone 6 while locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/factory-reset-locked-iphone-without-itunes-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the " Sleep/Wake " button and the " Home " button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.

**Step 2:** After 10 seconds have passed, release the " Sleep/Wake " button but keep holding the " Home " button.

**Step 3:** Keep holding the " Home " button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

**Step 4:** Here, you will be in recovery mode, and now you can reset your Apple iPhone 8.

Your device will now be reset, and you will have a phone like a new one.

### 5\. How can I get into a locked iPhone?

If you have lost the passcode of your Apple iPhone 8, then you can use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool to factory reset your device. To do this, you need to proceed with the steps given above. They are easy to follow and will help you reset your device without risk.

### The Bottom Line

These are some of the most effective methods that can help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes. You can use any of these methods to reset your device and get rid of the lock screen.

However, if you want to factory reset your Apple iPhone 8 because you have forgotten your passcode, we recommend using Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock app because it is the most effective and safe method.

This app can help you factory reset your locked iPhone without iTunes in just a few minutes, and it is very easy to use. So, if you want to reset your device without any data loss, we recommend using this app.
