## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

## Part 3: How to unlock iPhone passcode without iTunes using iCloud?

If your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is already in sync with iCloud and you have enabled the Find My iPhone feature, then you can easily learn how to unlock iPhone passcode remotely. The service was originally introduced to locate a lost iPhone. Though, it can also erase an iPhone entirely without much trouble. To learn how to unlock iPhone 6 passcode using iCloud, follow these steps:

1\. Visit the official website of iCloud and sign-in using your account credentials. This should be the same account that is in sync with your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.

2\. On the home page, you will find various options. Click on “Find iPhone” to learn how to unlock iPhone 5 passcode.

Nevertheless, you can give it a try and learn how to unlock iPhone 6 without a password by following these steps:

1\. Unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and press the Home button to activate Siri.

2\. Provide a command like “What time is it” to get the current time with the display of the clock icon.
