## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 15  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 15 device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 15 device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 15 device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 15  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 15 from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 15, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 15 and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 15 does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 15

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 15, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 15:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 15 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 15 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 15 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 15/Apple iPhone 15 mini/Apple iPhone 15 Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 15 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 15 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 15 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 15 range builds on the Apple iPhone 15 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 15 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 15 lineup. the Apple iPhone 15 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 15 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 15 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 15 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 15 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 15 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 15 12 mini was.
