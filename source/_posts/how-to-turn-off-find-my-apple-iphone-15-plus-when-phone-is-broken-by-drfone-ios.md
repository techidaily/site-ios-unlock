## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

### Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus Locked to Owner

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.
