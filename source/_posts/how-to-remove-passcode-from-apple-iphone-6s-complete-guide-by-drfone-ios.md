## FAQs

### 1\. Can a Factory Reset Bypass the Lock screen Passcode on iPhone?

Yes. A factory reset will bypass the lock screen passcode on your Apple iPhone 6s and allow you to access it without a passcode. However, all your data will disappear, so make sure you have a backup.

### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone 6s set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone 6s to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:

![hard reset iphone 6 while locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/factory-reset-locked-iphone-without-itunes-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the " Sleep/Wake " button and the " Home " button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.

**Step 2:** After 10 seconds have passed, release the " Sleep/Wake " button but keep holding the " Home " button.

**Step 3:** Keep holding the " Home " button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

**Step 4:** Here, you will be in recovery mode, and now you can reset your Apple iPhone 6s.

Your device will now be reset, and you will have a phone like a new one.

### 5\. How can I get into a locked iPhone?

If you have lost the passcode of your Apple iPhone 6s, then you can use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool to factory reset your device. To do this, you need to proceed with the steps given above. They are easy to follow and will help you reset your device without risk.
