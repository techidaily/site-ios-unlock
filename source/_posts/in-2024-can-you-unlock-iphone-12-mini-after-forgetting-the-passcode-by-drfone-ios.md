### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 mini passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 12 mini in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 12 mini device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 mini passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 12 mini, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 12 mini transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 12 mini to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 12 mini.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 12 mini and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

### 4\. Use Siri

You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 12 mini passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that's just the beginning.
