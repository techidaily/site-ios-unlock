## Apple iPhone 6s Plus Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking? Here's the Fix

## Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?

When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!

In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.

![encrypt local backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg)

Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 6s Plus backup unlocking never set by you.

But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let's talk about them.

## Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password

Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.

One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.

There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

### 1\. Try all passwords you use on iPhone

When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?

To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.

A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.

Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.

### 2\. Find the password from Keychain on macOS

You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.

The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.

1. On your macOS, go to **Utilities** by clicking the **Applications** menu item. At this point, launch the **Keychain Access app** and look for your Apple iPhone 6s Plus backup.
2. To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.
3. On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 6s Plus backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg)

### 3\. "Reset All Settings"

Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 6s Plus backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.

Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:

**Step 1:** Unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, and then open the **Settings** app on your device.

**Step 2:** After locating the **General** menu, go to the **Reset** menu and then hit the **Reset All Settings** button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 6s Plus.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.

**Step 4:** The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.

You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.

**Step 1:** Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus using iCloud.

**Step 2:** After you have opened the **Settings** app, go to the **General** menu, then to the **Reset** menu, and finally to the **Erase All Content and Settings** option.

![reset in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg)

**Step 3:** Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to factory settings, and wait until it is done.

**Step 4:** Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the **Apps & Data** option.

**Step 5:** Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.

You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.

On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.

### 4\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

**First step:** After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled **"Screen Unlock."**

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2:** While in the interface for **Screen Unlock**, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled **"Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption."** This will allow you to proceed.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3:** When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.

Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the **"Remove Now"** button:

- Check to ensure that **"Find My iPhone"** is not turned on.
- During this procedure, you should not launch **"iTunes."**
- During the process, your Apple iPhone 6s Plus will restart.

![connected](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

**Step 4:** If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won't take a lot of time at all.

![checking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png)

**Step 5:** The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus backup never set in the first place!

![removed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png)


### The Bottom Line

There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone 6s Plus backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to "Reset All Settings" on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus.

Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to avoid the problem of iTunes backup password never set.
