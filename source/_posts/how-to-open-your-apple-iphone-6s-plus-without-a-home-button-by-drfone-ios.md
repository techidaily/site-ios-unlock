## Apple iPhone 6s Plus Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If youâ€™ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 6s Plus displays the passcode lock, even if you havenâ€™t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you wonâ€™t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, youâ€™re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today weâ€™re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Donâ€™t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps youâ€™re trying random numbers and letters, or youâ€™re trying passwords youâ€™ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, youâ€™re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer youâ€™ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldnâ€™t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you donâ€™t know the passcode and canâ€™t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you donâ€™t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If youâ€™re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesnâ€™t get much better than this. Hereâ€™s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so youâ€™re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2.** Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.

![android ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3.** You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4.** Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. Youâ€™ll be able to select which device youâ€™re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17/14.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5.** Once everything has been confirmed and youâ€™re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when itâ€™s done, the software will say youâ€™re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and use it without a lock screen!

Thatâ€™s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!

![ drfone advanced unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png)

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didnâ€™t have a lock screen.

Itâ€™s only possible to do this if youâ€™ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why youâ€™re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Hereâ€™s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure youâ€™re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, youâ€™ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where youâ€™ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, youâ€™ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and use it without a lock screen!

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg)

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it wonâ€™t have the effect youâ€™re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesnâ€™t work, or you havenâ€™t got a backup file to load, youâ€™ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Hereâ€™s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone youâ€™re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure youâ€™re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure youâ€™re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 6s Plus in the situation where itâ€™s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data donâ€™t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure youâ€™re using it to get it to work. Hereâ€™s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process weâ€™ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to erase, and once completed, youâ€™ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary

And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17/14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!
