## Unlocking Apple iPhone 14  Lock Screen: 3 Foolproof Methods that Actually Work

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

The competition in the market between Android and iOS has been increased ever since the features are increasing. People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.

Looking more into the Apple iPhone 14 world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 14 . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.

## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 14  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 14 device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 14 device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 14 device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 14  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

## **Part 2. Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Apple iPhone 14  without Passcode \[No iTunes\]**

The major difference between the lock screen and activation lock is that the lock screen can be bypassed without the password but, the user can never bypass the activation lock as it marks the security boundary of Apple.

You might be wondering how to escape the lock screen without a password because it is possible that you might forget the password, and now you can't open your phone. Let's look at how you can do this;

The commonly faced problem of many iOS users was that they forget the password but later, an amazing solution to this problem as [Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) application was known and used by almost all iOS users. Some of its features are;

- The application is easy to use. It does not need any technical skill to use it, and everyone can handle the application.
- It can unlock a disabled iPhone even if the user doesn't have the passcode.
- It fully supports iPhone 8, iPhone X, and all the latest models of iPhone.

## Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country

**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 14** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

**Pros**

- **Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By **changing your App Store country**, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to **change your App Store country**.
- **Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. **Changing your App Store country** can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.
- **Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.

**Cons**

- **Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you've made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.
- **Offload Apps.**When you **change your App Store country**, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.
- **Family Sharing Issues.**If you're part of a Family Sharing group, **changing your App Store country** can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones.

So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 14 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 14 is locked now. What to do? Read on.
