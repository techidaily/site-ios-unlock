No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Keep waiting until the restoration completes. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and follow the on-screen directions. That will allow you to set up and utilize your device.
