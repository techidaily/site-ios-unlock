In another case, Apple allows you to temporarily sign in to your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max using a recently changed passcode within 72 hours. But once you get into your device, set a new passcode immediately to retain your full access.

## Part 4. Using iTunes To Set Up iOS Device Again

iTunes service allows you to reset your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to factory settings and unlock the screen lock if **the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode changes on its own**. Using iTunes to set up your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max again is a good and safe method, but it removes your device data. If you can compromise losing data, you can follow these instructions to remove the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Passcode Changed Itself issue using iTunes:

**Instructions.** Firstly, launch iTunes on your desktop and connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. Then, you need to progress into putting your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max in the [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263?at=1l3vrSk&ct=3e7454cbe7984ec49e91a8ace8e4198f). Continuing this, iTunes detects your device in Recovery Mode and shows two options: "Update" or "Restore." Click on the "Restore" option and hit the "OK" button to restore your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and regain access.

## Part 5. Using iCloud To Set Up iOS Device Again

Using iCloud to unlock iOS devices is a safe and recommended method, but it also leads to complete data loss. If you wish to consider using the iCloud method, it is important for the Find My service to be active on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device. Also, you need to be aware of your Apple ID and password before proceeding. Follow this comprehensive guide step-by-step to set up your iOS device again using iCloud.

- **Step 1.** First of all, open iCloud on your desktop web browser. Afterward, enter your “Apple ID” and “Password” to proceed. After trusting the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device, look for the "Grid" icon on the top right to find the "Find My" option in the list.

![access find my service from icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-8.jpg)

- **Step 2.** After that, choose the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device that you want to recover. Then, click the "Erase This Device" option to remove data and regain your device access.

## Part 6. Using Find My App To Set Up iOS Device Again

This method needs you to have another iOS device signed into the same Apple ID with the Find My option enabled. After fulfilling these preconditions, you can follow these steps to set up your device whose **iPhone passcode changed from 4 to 6 digits by itself:**

- **Step 1.** Launch the Find My App on any other device, select the "Devices" tab from the bottom menu, find your locked iPhone in the list, and tap on that.
- **Step 2.** You must select the “Erase This Device” button to remove it from the iCloud account. This will instantly factory reset the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device as if it is a new iOS device.
