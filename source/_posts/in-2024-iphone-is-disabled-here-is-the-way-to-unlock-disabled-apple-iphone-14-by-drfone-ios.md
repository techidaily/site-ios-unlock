### II.IV: Unlock Disabled iPhone Without A Computer (Find My App)

Not so long ago, a computer was a necessity in every household for various reasons. Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 14 and iPad.

The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users' requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.

So, in today's time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?

Worry not, because Apple's Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.

**Step 1:** Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 14 device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).
