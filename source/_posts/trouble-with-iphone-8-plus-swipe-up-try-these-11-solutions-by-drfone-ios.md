### 1\. How to select your favorite wallpaper

The second way to have a customized lock screen is to use a Live Photo. To do this, go to Settings > Wallpapers & Brightness > Choose a New Wallpaper. Then, select the Live Photo option and choose the image you want to use.

**Note:** You can only use Live Photos for your lock screen if your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is unlocked.

### 2\. How to manage notifications

If you want to manage notifications on the iOS 17 lock screen, there are two ways to do it.

At first, you can go to Settings > Notifications. Here, you can choose how many notifications you want to see on your lock screen and which apps can send you notifications.

The Do Not Disturb feature is the second way to manage notifications. To do this, go to Settings > Do Not Disturb and enable the feature. You can also schedule when Do Not should turn on and off. This feature work like a charm if you want to silence all notifications at night.

### 3\. How to set Auto-Lock time

By default, the Auto-Lock time is set to 30 seconds. But you can choose to lock it immediately, after 1 minute, 5 minutes, or never.

## How to Turn Off/On Lock Screen in iOS 17?

If you want to turn off the lock screen, go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode (or Face ID & Passcode). Then, scroll down and disable the Unlock with Passcode (or Unlock with Face ID) option.

Enable the Unlock with Passcode (or Unlock with Face ID) to turn ON the lock screen.

But if you have forgotten your passcode, don't worry. The next section will show you how to bypass the lock screen.

## How to Bypass the iOS 17 Lock Screen Passcode?

Different methods can help you bypass the iOS 17 lock screen passcode. Let's discuss them in detail.

### 1\. Use Emergency call

The first method to bypass the passcode is to use the emergency call feature.

To do this, access your device with five wrong passcodes attempts. This will trigger the emergency call feature. All you need to do is, dial an emergency number and then tap on the cancel button, and you'll be taken to the home screen.

That's how you bypass the lock screen without losing any data.
