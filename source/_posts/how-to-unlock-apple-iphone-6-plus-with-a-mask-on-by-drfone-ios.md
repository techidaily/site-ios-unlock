The competition in the market between Android and iOS has been increased ever since the features are increasing. People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

### Fix 9. Customize Touch Accommodations

Touch Accommodations is an accessibility feature on iPhones. It is designed to modify touch sensitivity and enhance touchscreen interactions for users. Customizing these settings might resolve issues with unresponsive gestures like the swipe-up function. Here's how to customize Touch Accommodations to fix **the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 12 won't swipe up to unlock**:

**Step 1.** Move to the "Accessibility" settings of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and select "Touch." On the following screen, scroll down and tap "Touch Accommodations."

### Fix 10. Turn Off Reduce Motion

Reduce Motion is an accessibility setting on iPhones designed to reduce animations and visual effects. It is particularly for users sensitive to motion effects.

Here's how to turn off Reduce Motion to fix the **iPhone 11 won’t swipe up to unlock**:

**Step 1.** Go through your iOS device Settings to open the "Accessibility" tab. Here, find and tap the "Motion" option to proceed.

### Fix 11. Reset iPhone All Settings

Note that this action will reset all settings on your device, but it won't delete your data. Here's how to reset all settings to fix **iPhone swipe not working**:

**Step 1.** Go to your device's "General" settings and scroll down to tap the second last option, "Transfer or Reset iPhone." On the following screen, press "Reset" from the available two options.
