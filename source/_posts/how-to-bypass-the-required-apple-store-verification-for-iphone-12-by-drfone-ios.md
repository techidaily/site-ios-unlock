## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 12

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 12 or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 12 or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In

Sometimes, simply [<u>signing out of your Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html) and then signing back in can resolve the issue. Go to the **Settings** app, tap your name at the top, and scroll down to **Sign Out**. After signing out, restart your device and then sign back in. This can help refresh your account settings and clear up any minor glitches.

Remember, these methods are about bypassing the verification process and ensuring your account is up-to-date and secure. Regularly checking your Apple ID settings and payment information can prevent many common issues with the App Store, including the frustrating ‘Verification Required’ prompt.

## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone 12

Being locked out of your new iPhone can be a frustrating experience. It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 12 device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 12 device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 12 device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 12 device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 12 device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone 12 device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 12 device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 12 Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone 12 locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 12 device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 12 device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 12:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 12 device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 12:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

![select find my feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg)

- ****Step 2:**** On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 12 from "All Devices." Now choose "Erase iPhone" from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 12 device and remove the Activation Lock.

![tap on erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg)

### Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Locked to Owner

When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 12 device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 12 to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.

The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 12 device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Activation Lock:

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 12 is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 12 Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.
- ****Step 2:**** Select "More Wi-Fi Settings" using the "i" symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose "Configure DNS" and follow it by selecting the "Manual" option.
- ****Step 3:**** Afterward, press "Add Server," located under "DNS Servers." Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:

- For users in the United States/North America: 104.154.51.7
- For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90
- For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58
- For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60

![use the dns method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg)

- ****Step 4:**** Save the changes by selecting "Save." Use the back arrow button to go back and choose "Ask to Join Networks." Enter the network password and tap "Join." Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone 12 attempts to activate. Afterward, continue to set up your Apple iPhone 12.

### Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service

What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn't working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone 12. All you need to provide them is your Apple iPhone 12 IMEI number. The process is done remotely and takes 24 to 48 hours to complete.

Ensure your device IMEI is not blacklisted before sending it for the unlocking process. Described below are steps to use [<u>DirectUnlocks</u>](https://directunlocks.com/en_us/icloud-unlock), an iCloud Activation removal service:

- ****Step 1:**** Use your computer's browser to visit the official DriectUnlocks website. Enter your Apple iPhone 12's IMEI number and select the Apple iPhone 12 model in the provided box.
- ****Step 2:**** Once you have entered the details, tap "Remove Activation Lock." Afterward, select a payment method to pay for the service. It will take up to 48 hours to unlock your device.
