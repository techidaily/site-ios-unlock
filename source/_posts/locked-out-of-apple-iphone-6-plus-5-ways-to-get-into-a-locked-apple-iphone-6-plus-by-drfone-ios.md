## Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country

**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

**Pros**

- **Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By **changing your App Store country**, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to **change your App Store country**.
- **Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. **Changing your App Store country** can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.
- **Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries.

**Cons**

## Part 4: How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Use USB Accessories without Passcode via iCloud?

With iCloud, you can quickly clean up your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, remove screen locks, and help unlock your device. But, you have to know that all your data will be erased. Make sure your Apple iPhone 6 Plus has the "Find My iPhone" function enabled, otherwise your device will be offline.

**Step 1:** Open your computer or another iOS device, and sign in with your Apple account.

Now, your Apple iPhone 6 Plus will reboot without a passcode. Then, you can unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to use accessories and bypass the passcode.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Use USB Accessories without Passcode via iTunes?

There is currently no way to unlock an iPhone without erasing all data. Luckily, iTunes can help back up your data before removing it. Please note that this way is **only possible if the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device has synced data in iTunes before.**

- **Step 1:** Connect Apple iPhone 6 Plus to a computer with a USB accessory and turn on iTunes. Then iTunes will make a backup for your phone.
- **Step 2:** Choose “Restore iPhone”.

Wait for a while and you could unlock the screen to use USB accessories. However, in step one, you may need to enter your passcode to get stuck during the process. Therefore, this method is not the most efficient.

## Part 6: How to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Use USB Accessories without Passcode via Recovery Mode?

If you have forgotten your Apple ID or password and have not synced iCloud and iTunes, you can choose recovery mode. It will remove all your passcode and data as well.

- **Step 1:** You need to prepare a Mac or PC (Windows 8 or later).
- **Step 2:** Turn off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.
- **Step 3:** Put your device in recovery mode. This step might be a little complicated, but don't worry, we'll walk you through it step by step.

1\. Find the button on your device, it will be useful then.

- iPhone SE (1st generation), iPhone 6s, and earlier: The Home button.
- iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: The Volume down button.
- iPhone SE (2nd and 3rd generation), iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, and later devices: The side button.

2\. Quickly press and hold the button while connecting your phone and computer until the recovery mode appears.

## Part 7: Hot FAQ about USB Accessories on iPhone

### Q1: What is the feature of USB Accessories on iPhone?

From USB-A to the latest, USB-C. Also, most iPhones use a proprietary Lightning port.

### Q2: Why does My iPhone Think My Charger is a USB Accessory?

It is related to the capacity of the charger. If a low-capacity charger is used, your device must regard it as a USB port because the USB port charges at a lower rate than a good wall charger. Another possibility is that the cable being used is flaky.

### Q3: What to Do If My iPhone Not Charging after Unlock to Use Accessories?

- **Step 1**: Disconnect your tool from the accessory.
- **Step 2**: Unlock your device.
- **Step 3**: Connect the USB accessory again.

If it doesn’t work, please contact customer service of Apple.

### Conclusion

It is very common to use USB accessories to connect iPhone and computer. Sometimes, we may forget the password, or cannot unlock the screen due to system failure. There are many ways to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to use the accessories in the article. Finally, we recommend everyone to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, a helpful and convenient tool.
