### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.
