## Part 4: Turn off Find My iPhone using Recovery Mode

The recovery model of the Apple iPhone 6s allows you to reset or restore your data. It also offers data cleaning and backing up of apps to keep your Apple iPhone 6s updated and free of glitches. When your phone is lagging or not working properly, then you need to put it into Recovery Mode.

However, Recovery Mode can also be useful to turn off Find My iPhone on your device. Here are the steps that will guide you on how to turn off Find My iPhone on a broken phone using Recovery Mode.

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 6s to your computer via cable and wait for your computer to detect your device.
