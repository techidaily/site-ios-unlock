Two things can happen on the tenth failed attempt to unlock your Apple iPhone X. If you have **Erase Data** enabled, your phone's data gets wiped.

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode** or **Touch ID & Passcode**, depending on your device. Enter your current passcode.

### How To Disable Erase Data Mode

Here are the steps to disable Erase Data Mode on your Apple iPhone X, ensuring controlled access to your device.
