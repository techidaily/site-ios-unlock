## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus, Apple's New iPhone

So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus Locked?
