### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You only need to wait for some time as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don't interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.

Once the process is completed, your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.

This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.


## How Can I Turn On/Off the Passcode on My iPhone?

If you want to turn the Passcode ON your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, then follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Go to 'Settings' and select 'Touch ID & Passcode' (if you're using an iPhone with Touch ID). If you're using an iPhone without a Touch ID, select 'Passcode.'

![how to turn passcode on or off on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-7.jpg)

**Step 2:** Enter your current Passcode when prompted.

**Step 3:** Scroll down and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'ON' position.

**Step 4:** Enter a new 6-digit passcode when prompted. Then, please enter it again to confirm.

That's it! Your Passcode is now turned ON, and your device is more secure than ever.

To shut down the Passcode on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, follow the steps above and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'OFF' position.

### The Bottom Line

It is a professional tool that can unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max without a passcode. Plus, it doesn't cause any damage to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, which is always a good thing.

If you're not interested in using a third-party tool, you can try one of the methods mentioned above. But keep in mind that these methods may only work on some iPhones. So, if you need help deciding which way to use it, we recommend going with Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock.
