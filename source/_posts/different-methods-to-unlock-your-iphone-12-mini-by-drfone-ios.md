### 3\. Understand Terms and Conditions

Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud's Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 12 mini's data.

Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.

### 4\. Follow Instructions Carefully

Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.

Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.

### 5\. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 12 mini 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn't been unlocked during this time.

When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the computer.

## Conclusion

To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 mini can be daunting when you've forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues. Thankfully, there are different methods available to regain access to your device. This article explored three methods: using iCloud's Find My iPhone, restoring with iTunes, and utilizing Dr.Fone.

Step 7: Select the firmware package after the download completes. After the download completes, you can click Unlock Now to start unlocking the Apple iPhone 12 mini.

In a short while, your Apple iPhone 12 mini will be unlocked. It is important to note that unlocking a locked Apple iPhone 12 mini cannot be done without wiping data.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 12 mini device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 12 mini, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 12 mini.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 12 mini and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 12 mini and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 12 mini was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 12 mini in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 12 mini

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 mini, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you.

Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 12 mini:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

![turn passcode off](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-8.jpg)

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 12 mini leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 12 mini itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 12 mini device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
