It would help if you erased your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to eliminate the lock and passcode, then re-sync it with iTunes. Then, you can restore your phone from an iCloud or an iTunes backup, but if you have never used a backup on your phone, your phone will have nothing.

## Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Without A Computer

There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and return the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if youâ€™re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone â€“ Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone's [iOS Phone Backup feature](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

## Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max again.

### Tip 1: About Passcodes

- 1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
- 1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
- 1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
- 1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

### Tip 2: Use Face ID

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

## Conclusion

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and unlock Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max/Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max mini/Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Pro

You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max 12 mini was.
