## Part 1. Decoding the Apple iPhone 7 Blacklist: What You Need To

You might have heard the term "blacklisted iPhone" before, but what does it mean? Well, it's like your Apple iPhone 7 is in a timeout and can't play with the other phones. Let's break it down in simple terms.

![iphone blacklisted](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg)

### What Is a Blacklisted iPhone?

When an iPhone is blacklisted, it's been labeled as "not-so-friendly" in the digital world. It's like when you're not allowed into an establishment because you broke the rules. In this case, the Apple iPhone 7 has done something that makes it unwelcome on specific networks.

### Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?

There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:

- **Reported as Lost or Stolen.**Imagine if someone reported their iPhone as lost or stolen. If someone else tries to use that phone, it could be blacklisted. That's because protecting the original owner's data and privacy is essential.
- **Unpaid Bills.**Sometimes, an iPhone gets blacklisted because the person who had it didn't pay their bills. Not paying your phone bill can have consequences.

### What Happens When Your Apple iPhone 7 Is Blacklisted?

Now, here's where things get tricky. When your Apple iPhone 7 is blacklisted, it won't work like it should. Here's what you might experience:

- **No Calls or Texts.**You won't be able to make or receive calls and texts. It's like your Apple iPhone 7 is suddenly mute.
- **No Internet.**Say goodbye to surfing the web or using apps that need an internet connection. Your Apple iPhone 7 will be like a disconnected island.
- **Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 7, its value will drop if it's blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.

So, in a nutshell, a blacklisted iPhone is like a digital pariah, shunned from regular phone activities. But the good news is, you don't have to stay in timeout forever. In the next part, this guide will show you how to get your Apple iPhone 7 back in action with some easy-to-follow **iPhone blacklist removal** steps.

## Part 2. How To Remove and Unlock an iPhone Blacklist for Free

Now that you know what it means for an Apple iPhone 7 to be blacklisted and the troubles it can bring, let's talk about how to set your Apple iPhone 7 free. The good news is there's a way to do this for free! Yes, you read that right. This section will walk you through the steps.

![iphone blacklist removal](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-03.jpg)

### What Is iPhone Blacklisted Removal?

Going through a **blacklist removal service for your Apple iPhone 7** is like giving your device a second chance. It's taking your Apple iPhone 7 off the "naughty list" and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.

### Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal

The **iPhone blacklist removal** method is relatively easy. Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Contact the Original Owner**

One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 7 is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 7 ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.

**Option 2: Contact Your Carrier**

Your next option is to contact your carrier for an **iPhone blacklist removal service**. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 7. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.

If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 7 device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.

Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you're patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.

## Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted

Now that you've learned how to [rescue a blacklisted iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html) let's talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place. Prevention is always better than a cure, right? Here are some easy steps to make sure your Apple iPhone 7 stays in the clear.

![how to avoid iphone blacklist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-04.jpg)

### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone 7 Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 7. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 7 getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 7's data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 7's status.

### Report a Lost or Stolen iPhone

If your Apple iPhone 7 ever goes missing, report it to your carrier and the police immediately. The step will help prevent someone else from using it and getting it blacklisted.

### Beware of Scams

Stay vigilant for scams and sketchy deals. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Avoid buying iPhones from unreliable sources or individuals you don't trust.

By following these simple preventive measures, you can keep your device clear and avoid the hassle of dealing with the whole **iPhone blacklist removal** process. Remember, a little caution goes a long way.

## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 7 With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesn't Work

![man wearing apple watch with Apple iPhone 7 by him](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch.jpg)

There are plenty of reasons why Apple devices are in such high demand. The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 7’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.

However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.

With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 7’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.

Moreover, you might be able to **use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 7**.

Now, you cannot just **unlock any Apple iPhone 7 with your Watch**. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Here’s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.


## Part 1. Can I Use an Apple Watch To Unlock My Apple iPhone 7?

![phone, earphones, and apple watch on a table](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-2.jpg)

The Apple iPhone 7 face ID is one of the simplest, most practical ways to unlock your phone. While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.

With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.

The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.

What could work is your Apple Watch.

Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 7 model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. It’s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.

## Part 2. Requirements for Unlocking Apple iPhone 7 With Apple Watch

![unlock requirements](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-3.jpg)

Unfortunately, not every Apple iPhone 7 can be unlocked with your Apple Watch, and not every Apple Watch can unlock your Apple iPhone 7. Both devices must meet some requirements before you can adjust your settings to enable this option.

To be able to use your Apple Watch to unlock your phone with the utmost ease, you’ll need:

- An Apple iPhone 7 with Face ID – Apple iPhone 7 X and newer models;
- iOS 14.5 and newer versions;
- An Apple Watch series 3 and newer models;
- watchOS 7.4 and newer versions.

Additional requirements you’ll need to meet include:

- Your Apple iPhone 7 and Apple Watch need to be paired;
- Both devices need to have WiFi and Bluetooth turned on (but a connection to a WiFi network isn’t necessary);
- You need to have a passcode on your Apple Watch;
- Wrist detection on your watch needs to be turned on;
- The watch needs to be on your wrist and unlocked.

You’ll also need to wear items such as sunglasses, face coverings, ski masks, or others that prevent you from using your Apple iPhone 7 Face ID.

## Part 3. How To Unlock Apple iPhone 7 With an Apple Watch

![a cyclist wearing an apple watch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-4.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type in your passcode;
- **Step 3:** Find and enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**.

Remember that your Apple Watch’s wrist detection must be turned on for this option to work. When you tap to enable **Unlock with Apple Watch**, if your wrist detection isn’t turned on, you’ll get a prompt on your phone asking you to turn it on.

You can turn on wrist detection on your watch by following these steps:

- **Step 4:** Go to **Settings**on your Apple Watch;
- **Step 5:** Tap on the **Passcode**;
- **Step 6:** Toggle **Wrist Detection**

![apple watch wrist detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-6.jpg)

Now that you’ve enabled the option to unlock your Apple iPhone 7 using your Apple Watch, it’s time to simply start using the feature. To unlock your phone, you’ll need to:

- Have your Apple Watch on your wrist, unlocked;
- Tap on your Apple iPhone 7 or raise it to your face to activate it;
- Glance at your phone while wearing a face mask, sunglasses, or another item that’s preventing you from using Face ID;
- Swipe up on your phone’s screen.

Your Apple Watch will send an alert when you’ve used it to unlock your Apple iPhone 7. If you accidentally unlock your phone, simply tap on the **Lock Apple iPhone 7** on the screen of your watch to lock it.

However, remember that the next time you want to use your Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 7, you’ll first need to type in your passcode.

## Part 4. What To Do if You Can’t Unlock Your Apple iPhone 7 With a Watch

![person wearing face mask unlocking their Apple iPhone 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/unlock-iphone-with-watch-7.jpg)

Generally speaking, unlocking your Apple iPhone 7 with an Apple Watch should be a simple, seamless task. Unfortunately, though, that’s not always the case. A glitch or a bug could be preventing you from enjoying this feature, so take a look at a few things you could try to fix it.

Make sure that you have:

- A passcode on your watch;
- Wrist detection turned on;
- Feature **Unlock with Apple Watch**turned on on your Apple iPhone 7.

If all the settings are correct, try one of the following options.

### 2. Restart Your WiFi/Bluetooth Connection

Remember, you only need WiFi and Bluetooth on but don’t need to be connected to a WiFi network.

If the problem persists, you could also restart your devices and try again.

### 3. Reset Your Face ID

To perform a hard reset, simultaneously press and hold the power button and digital crown.
