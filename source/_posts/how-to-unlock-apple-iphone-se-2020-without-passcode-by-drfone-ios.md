**Step 1. Plug the iDevice into your system**

Run the Dr.Fone on your system and select the "Screen Unlock" option from the main menu.

![select screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Use a connector to connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to the PC. After this, click the "Unlock iOS Screen" option on the program.

**Step 2. Access the Recovery or DFU Mode**

Before the Apple iPhone SE (2020) lock screen removal, we need to boot the phone in Recovery or DFU. If you have to do so, follow the steps given in the image below:

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

We suggest you open the recovery mode to remove the iOS screen lock. However, if you can't figure out how to do so, go for the DFU mode.

**Step 3. Affirm Device Model information**

After going to the DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the information about your Apple iPhone SE (2020). From the following screen, confirm your phone model and iOS version. If it is isn't correctly given, select the correct data pair from the drop-down menu. Then download the firmware package for your Apple iPhone SE (2020).

**Step 4. Open the Lock**

Click Unlock Now after downloading the firmware.

![unlock now](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png)

After a short while, your Apple iPhone SE (2020) will be opened effectively. However, this process will erase every bit of data off your phone. Honestly speaking, there is no answer for this issue without data loss.


### The Bottom Line

It is the end of a detailed guide with the top strategies on **how to unlock disabled iPhones without computer**. You should get the right approach per your circumstance and follow the steps.

If you don't know which strategy will turn out best for you, we suggest utilizing Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock. It has a close to 100% success rate and is not difficult to use for individuals without a tech foundation. So, install it on your system for a quicker result.
