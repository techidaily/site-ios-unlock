## Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do?

If you’ve recently updated your iOS iPhone and iPad to the iOS 17/14 operating system, you may notice a bit of a bug where the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max displays the passcode lock, even if you haven’t got a security code in place.

This obviously means you won’t be able to access your phone, and in many cases, you’re going to want to get back into your phone as quickly as possible. However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!

## Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly

One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.

The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.

## Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17/14 Update

### 2.1 Try a default passcode in your family

While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.

![iphone random passcodes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg)

In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.

### 2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool

The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.

This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17/14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.

When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2.** Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.

![android ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3.** You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

**Step 4.** Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17/14.

![ ios unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png)

**Step 5.** Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and use it without a lock screen!

That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!

### 2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes

Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.

It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;

**Step 1.** Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.

**Step 2.** In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.

**Step 3.** Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and use it without a lock screen!

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg)

### 2.4 Restore in recovery mode

In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17/14 update.

If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.

Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).

**Step 1.** Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.

**Step 3.** iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.

### 2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud

The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17/14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.

While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.

Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.

**Step 1.** From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.

![find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg)

**Step 2.** Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.

**Step 3.** From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.

Leave the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17/14 without any problems!

## Summary

And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17/14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!

## What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max i Do? Get Answers here

Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But **what does jailbreaking an iPhone do**? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.

However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It's a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.

To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on [<u>iCloud Activation Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html). Let's start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.

![iphone devices back view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?

Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, it's crucial to understand, "**What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone**?" While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you'll learn both aspects.

Benefits of Jailbreaking

Apple's App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max:

- **Install Unapproved Apps**

Apple's App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.

- **Increased Customization Options**

Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.

![circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg)

- **Unlocking System-wide Features**

Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren't in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max based on your preferences.

- **Unlocking Network Restrictions**

Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.

However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.

Risks of Jailbreaking

While jailbreaking itself isn't illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple's security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**

Bypassing Apple's security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.

- **Voided Warranty**

Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won't cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.

- **Instability and Performance Issues**

Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in [<u>crashes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html), [<u>freezes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html), or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max's performance.

![iphone apps crashing message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg)

- **Difficulty in Updating**

Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.

- **Bricking Risk**

Incorrect jailbreaking can "[<u>brick</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html)" your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.

## Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?

Jailbreaking an iPhone won't remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device's system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here's how they differ:

- **Jailbreak**

**If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, what happens** is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.

- **iCloud Activation Lock**

iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.

![icloud activation lock on an iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg)

While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can't override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/), leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.

## Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password

Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering "**What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone**?"

Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you've forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner's details.

To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It's user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.

Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:
