### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.
