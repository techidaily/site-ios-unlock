**Send a Custom Text Message:** When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.

**Erase Data Remotely:** Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 14 Plus if you believe it's been some time since it's gone and you don't think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.

**Track Your Device on Map:** An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.

**Play Songs:** Playing a sound might assist you with finding your lost iPhone if it's still close by. The Apple iPhone 14 Plus will play a sound at top volume, no matter what volume level was set on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device when you lost it.

### 1\. Remove lost mode by entering the correct passcode

The most straightforward method for unlocking the Apple iPhone 14 Plus in Lost Mode is entering the password on the actual device. If your device was protected with a password before placing it in Lost Mode, enter it again.

If your device had no password while placing it in Lost Mode and you've entered it into iCloud while placing your Apple iPhone 14 Plus into Lost Mode, utilize this password. That will help you **unlock lost iPhone**, and you can start operating your Apple iPhone 14 Plus again.

### 2\. Remove it from Find My in iCloud

One more method for unlocking the Lost Mode on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is to utilize the Find My iPhone application on the official iCloud site. Follow the steps underneath to do so:

1. Go to <www.icloud.com> and utilize your account details to sign in.

4. Click the "Stop Lost Mode" button to remove the lock from the phone.
5. Confirm this activity by clicking the "Stop Lost Mode" button again.

### 3\. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone's information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device has an activation lock enabled.

The DNS bypass will send a fake "device isn't locked" message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions. Follow these steps to utilize the iCloud DNS bypassing strategy to **unlock lost iPhone**:

- Insert SIM in your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, turn it on, and select a preferred language and your location.
- A WiFi screen will spring up. Tap on the "I" icon. If you are now connected with your WiFi, tap "Forget this Network."

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-2.jpg)

- Tap on "Configure DNS," and enter a DNS server as per your region from the list underneath:

USA: 104.154.51.7

Asia: 104.155.28.90

Europe: 104.155.28.90

South America: 35.199.88.219

Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23

- Clean old DNS server off of ISP modem, select and connect to a WiFi network. Click the Back button when a popup says that the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is attempting to connect to the Apple servers.
- You will now be on the DNS bypass screen. Pick the applications from the list to keep using your device. However, only a handful of applications are available through this.

### 4\. Use Emergency Call

This technique is the most widely recognized one. You can bypass your iCloud activation by settling on a fake Emergency call. Nonetheless, it is accounted for that this strategy probably won't work for everyone.

If your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is on lost mode and attempting to unlock it, you can try using this method. Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your **iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:**

- Click the "Emergency Call" option on your locked device.

![emergency call](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg)

- Dial "\*#96274825\*0000\*1#," then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.
- If it's not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn't work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.
- Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again. Now create a new password after **iPhone Lost Mode unlock.**

### 5\. Apple iPhone Unlock
