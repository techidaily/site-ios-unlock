Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone X leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone X itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone X device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone X/Apple iPhone X mini/Apple iPhone X Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone X now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone X range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone X range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone X range builds on the Apple iPhone X 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone X 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone X lineup. the Apple iPhone X lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone X lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone X mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone X models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone X models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone X mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone X 12 mini was.
