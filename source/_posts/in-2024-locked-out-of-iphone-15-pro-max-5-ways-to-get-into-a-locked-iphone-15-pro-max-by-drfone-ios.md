## FAQs

### 1\. Can a Factory Reset Bypass the Lock screen Passcode on iPhone?

Yes. A factory reset will bypass the lock screen passcode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and allow you to access it without a passcode. However, all your data will disappear, so make sure you have a backup.

### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.

### 3\. What is the Difference Between a Soft Reset and a Hard Reset?

A soft reset is when you restart your device, and a hard reset is when you factory reset all the settings on your device and start fresh. A factory reset is a type of hard reset without losing the data.

### 4\. How do I force my iPhone 6 to factory reset with buttons?

To force your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to factory reset with buttons, you need to follow these steps:

![hard reset iphone 6 while locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/factory-reset-locked-iphone-without-itunes-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Press and hold the " Sleep/Wake " button and the " Home " button simultaneously for about 10 seconds.

**Step 2:** After 10 seconds have passed, release the " Sleep/Wake " button but keep holding the " Home " button.

**Step 3:** Keep holding the " Home " button until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.

**Step 4:** Here, you will be in recovery mode, and now you can reset your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Your device will now be reset, and you will have a phone like a new one.

### 5\. How can I get into a locked iPhone?
