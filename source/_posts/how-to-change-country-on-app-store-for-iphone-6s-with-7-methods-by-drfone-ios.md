## Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country

**Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 6s** can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It's necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.

**Pros**

- **Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By **changing your App Store country**, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to **change your App Store country**.
- **Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. **Changing your App Store country** can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.
- **Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.

**Cons**

- **Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you've made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.
- **Offload Apps.**When you **change your App Store country**, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.
- **Family Sharing Issues.**If you're part of a Family Sharing group, **changing your App Store country** can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 6s lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 6s mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 6s models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 6s models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 6s mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 6s 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 6s is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 6s and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s and unlocking it.
