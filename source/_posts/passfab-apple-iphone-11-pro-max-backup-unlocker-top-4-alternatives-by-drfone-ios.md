## Part 1: iPhone Backup Unlocker Specifications

### What is an iPhone backup password?

A passcode encrypts your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max's backups, allowing only you to access them. This passcode is referred to as an iPhone backup password.

![itunes password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-unlocker-2.jpg)

If you do not remember your password, you cannot view any data in your backup or restore it.

A few methods allow you to guess or brute-force your way into the password. Still, the most reliable method to unlock your backup is to use a professional tool such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, Passfab iPhone Backup Unlocker, or other iPhone backup unlockers. This group of software employs a sophisticated algorithm to figure out your password for you, and it has a high percentage of success.

Additionally, it is simple and can be finished in minutes rather than hours.
