## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion

The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 14 is unparalleled. Yet, with that convenience comes the risk of forgetting the passcode to the Apple iPhone 14 device, the need to enter the passcode is greatly minimized with Touch ID.

## How To Fix Auto Lock Greyed Out on Apple iPhone 14

Auto-lock on iOS devices serves multiple purposes - it conserves battery life, secures your data, and more. But have you encountered the **Auto-Lock greyed-out** dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.

Read on if you've encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we'll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix **Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone** and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven't worked for you, we've got alternative solutions. Let's get started.

![auto lock greyed out on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?

There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 14 or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:

Low Power Mode

When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.

![low power mode on iphone enabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg)

Screen Time Restrictions

[<u>Screen Time restrictions</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html) can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn't run out.

![screen time settings on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg)

MDM Profile Restrictions

If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can [<u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html).

![setup remote management on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg)

Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.

Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode

Your **iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out** because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Go to your Apple iPhone 14 or iPad's **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down and tap **Battery**. It will show you your device's battery usage and available settings.
- **Step 3:** Turn off the **Low Power Mode**. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.

![iphone turn off low power mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg)

Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in ****Settings**** so it stays awake for as long as you like.

Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions

You've ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the **Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad** or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn't causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Screen Time,** then scroll down.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Turn Off Screen Time**.

![turn off screen time on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg)

Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile

A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 14 device's default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.

Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out ****Auto-Lock on iPad****, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.

- **Step 1:** See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.

- Go to **Settings**\> **General** > **VPN & Device Management** on your Apple iPhone 14.
- Go to **Settings**\> **General** > **Profiles & Device Management** on your iPad.

- **Step 2:** Select the configuration profile you need to delete.
- **Step 3:** Tap **Remove Profile**, enter your device passcode, then tap **Remove**.

![remove configuration profile on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg)

Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM

Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees' iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.

If you're having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company's authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.

If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **General** > **Profile** or **VPN & Device Management** (or a similar section).
- **Step 3:** Select the management and tap **Remove Management**.

![remove mdm profile on ipad](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg)

If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company's mobile device management platform can remove it.

Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss

Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they're associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there's good news.
