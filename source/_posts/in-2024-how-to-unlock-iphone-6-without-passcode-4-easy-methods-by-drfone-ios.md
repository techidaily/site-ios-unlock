## 5 Easy Ways to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 without Passcode by Yourself

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the Find My iPhone function, then you can try it to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![use find My Apple iPhone 6 to unlock iphone 13 without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.

**Step 3:** Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.

**Step 4:** Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone 6 from the list of devices.

**Step 5:** Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.

**Step 6:** Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 6:

![how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 6 to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.

**Step 2:** Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.

**Step 3:** Once recognized, your Apple iPhone 6 will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.

**Step 4:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.

**Step 5:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock iPhone in Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 6:

![how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg)

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 6 to the computer and launch the iTunes application.

**Step 2:** Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

**Step 3:** As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.

**Step 4:** On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.

**Step 5:** Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.

**Step 6:** Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Siri (only iOS version 10)

You can use this hack to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode. But it just functions on devices running iOS 10 or lower. So, if you are using a newer version of iOS, this method won't work for you.

![iphone lock screen with siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-6.jpg)

Here's how you can use Siri to bypass the Passcode:

**Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.

**Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"

**Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock."

**Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

But this method will not work on newer iPhones 11/12/13 and iPhone 14 because they run on the latest iOS.

### 2\. Lock apps onApple iPhone 6 & iPad using App Locker

Besides the native iPhone app lock solutions, you can also take the assistance of a third-party tool. However, most of these apps only support jailbroken devices. Therefore, if you wish to use a dedicated app lock for your Apple iPhone 6, then you need to jailbreak your device. Needless to say, getting your device jailbroken has its perks and demerits. If you don’t want to jailbreak your device, then you can simply take the assistance of the above-mentioned solutions.

However, if you have a jailbroken device and would like to app lock the iPhone, then you can also use AppLocker. It is available at Cydia’s repository and can be purchased for just $0.99. It can be installed on your jailbroken device to get an added level of security. Not just apps, it can also be used to lock certain settings, folders, accessibilities, and more. To learn how to lock apps on iPhone using AppLocker, follow these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, get AppLocker on your device from <http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker>. As of now, it works on iOS 6 to 10 versions.

**Step 2.** After installing the tweak, you can go to Settings > Applocker to access it.

![iphone applocker](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136509845.jpg)

**Step 3.** To access the feature, make sure that you have “**Enabled**” it (by turning it on).

**Step 4.** This will let you set up a passcode to lock the apps and settings of your choice.

**Step 5.** To app lock, the iPhone, visit the “**Application Locking**” feature on your device.

![application locking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136826933.jpg)

**Step 6.** From here, you can turn on (or off) the locking feature for apps of your choice.

This will let your app lock the Apple iPhone 6 without any trouble. You can also go to the “Reset Password Phrase” to change the passcode.

### 3\. Lock Apps onApple iPhone 6 & iPad using BioProtect

Just like Applocker, BioProtect is another third-party tool that works only on jailbroken devices. It can also be downloaded from Cydia’s repository. Apart from apps, you can also use BioProtect to lock settings, SIM features, folders, and more. It is linked to the Touch ID of the Apple iPhone 6 device and scans the fingerprint of a user to grant (or deny) access to any app. The app only works on iPhone 5s and later devices, having a Touch ID. However, you can also set a passcode as well if your Touch ID is not working. To use the BioProtect app lock for iPhone, follow these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, get the BioProtect app to lock iPhone on your device from the right <http://cydia.saurik.com/package/net.limneos.bioprotect/>.

**Step 2.** To access the tweak’s panel, you need to provide your fingerprint access.

**Step 3.** Place your finger on your Touch ID and match its print.

![app is locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137022586.jpg)

**Step 4.** This will let you access the BioProtect app settings.

**Step 5.** Firstly, enable the app by turning the respective feature on.

**Step 6.** Under the “**Protected Applications**” section, you can see a list of all the major apps.

![protected applications](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137256044.jpg)

**Step 7.** Simply turn on (or off) the feature of the app that you wish to lock.

**Step 8.** You can also go to the “Touch ID” feature to further calibrate the app.

**Step 9.** After setting the lock, you would be asked to authenticate using your fingerprint to access the protected app.
