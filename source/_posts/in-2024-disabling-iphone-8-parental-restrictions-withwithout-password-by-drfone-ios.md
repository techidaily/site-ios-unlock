## Part 4: Tips to protect your Apple iPhone 8 from being unlocked by thieves

As you can see, anyone can learn how to unlock the disabled Apple iPhone 8 4 without a computer and other iOS devices as well. Therefore, if you don’t want your Apple iPhone 8 and iPad to be misused by thieves, you should take some added measures. Follow these suggestions to increase security on your iOS device.

1\. Disable Siri from the lock screen

If someone can’t access Siri from the lock screen, then they won’t be able to follow the above-mentioned process to unlock an iOS device. Therefore, it is highly recommended to disable Siri from the lock screen. To do this, visit your device’s Settings > Touch ID & Passcode, and under the “Allow access when locked” section, disable the option of “Siri.”

2\. Enable Find My Apple iPhone 8 service

There are times when users forget to enable the Find My Apple iPhone 8 feature on their iOS device. To access this feature, make sure that it is turned on. To do this, go to your device’s Settings > iCloud > Find My Apple iPhone 8 and turn on the feature of “Find My Apple iPhone 8.” Additionally, you should turn on the “Send the last location” option as well.

One of the best ways to secure your iOS device is by adding secure passwords. To do this, visit your device’s Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Change Passcode and select the option of “Custom Alphanumeric Code.” Provide a strong alphanumeric passcode to boost the security of your device.
