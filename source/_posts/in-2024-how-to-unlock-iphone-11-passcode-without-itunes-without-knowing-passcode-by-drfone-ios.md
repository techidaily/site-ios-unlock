Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 11, iPad, or iPod Contact.**
