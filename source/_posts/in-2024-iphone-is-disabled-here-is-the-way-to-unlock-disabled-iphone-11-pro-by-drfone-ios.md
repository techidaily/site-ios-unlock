### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 11 Pro in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

If the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device can't connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 11 Pro cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.

### 4\. Use Siri
