**Step 2. Access the Recovery or DFU Mode**

Before the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max lock screen removal, we need to boot the phone in Recovery or DFU. If you have to do so, follow the steps given in the image below:

![enter recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png)

We suggest you open the recovery mode to remove the iOS screen lock. However, if you can't figure out how to do so, go for the DFU mode.

**Step 3. Affirm Device Model information**

After going to the DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the information about your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. From the following screen, confirm your phone model and iOS version. If it is isn't correctly given, select the correct data pair from the drop-down menu. Then download the firmware package for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

Click Unlock Now after downloading the firmware.
