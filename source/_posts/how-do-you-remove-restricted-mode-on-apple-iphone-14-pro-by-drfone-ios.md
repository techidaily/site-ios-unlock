### Way 2. Restore iPhone From iTunes

Restoring an iPhone using iTunes is an alternative method for removing parental controls. iTunes is a multimedia management software that is developed by Apple. It provides various functions, including media playback and data synchronization. The most important function is the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device backup and restoration. Restoring your Apple iPhone 14 Pro via iTunes results in the complete erasure of all data and settings. Here is **how to disable restrictions on iPhones without password:**

- **Step 1.** Ensure that iTunes has been updated to the most recent version before opening the application. Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro to the computer and grant iTunes permission to recognize the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. After detecting the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, access the "Summary" tab by tapping the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device icon in iTunes. You can access the "Backups" section to create any backup before restoring.

You should proceed by clicking "Restore" to confirm. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to finalize the process.
