This is a great way to contact the owner of a lost iPhone. You can use this method if you cannot find the owner's phone number in the lost mode or medical ID.

![contact the owner with the picloud share photo library](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/i-found-an-iphone-how-do-i-unlock-it-8.jpg)

### 2\. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud

No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 12 mini will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" option before **forgotten iPhone PIN**, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.

To unlock iPhone through iCloud:

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.

**Step 2.** Click the "Find iPhone" option from the different choices available.

**Step 3.** Click "All Devices" and pick the Apple iPhone 12 mini device you need to unlock.

![icloud unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-3.jpg)

### 3\. Unlock it with iTunes

Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 12 mini in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone 12 mini device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.
