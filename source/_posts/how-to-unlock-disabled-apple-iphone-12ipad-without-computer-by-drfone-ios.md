While there is no direct way to regain access to your device when its passcode changes, you will have to [perform a factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) on your Apple iPhone 12 to make it reusable.

## Part 4. Using iTunes To Set Up iOS Device Again

iTunes service allows you to reset your Apple iPhone 12 to factory settings and unlock the screen lock if **the Apple iPhone 12 passcode changes on its own**. Using iTunes to set up your Apple iPhone 12 again is a good and safe method, but it removes your device data.
