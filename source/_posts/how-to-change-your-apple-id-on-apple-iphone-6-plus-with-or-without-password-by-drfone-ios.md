If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 6 Plus itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.
