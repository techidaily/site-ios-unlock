### 3\. Use Siri

If you're running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn't work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it's not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.

<a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Just follow the instructions.

- **Step 1:** Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Say something like "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, who am I?"
- **Step 3:** Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can't answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to "Tap to open Clock".
- **Step 4:** Tap on "Clock," and you'll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.

While this method doesn't give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device's features.

## Part 1. Reasons Why Apple ID Is Not Active

Understanding the causes behind “ why **my Apple ID is not active**” is necessary for resolving it. Several factors contribute to this problem, requiring attention for a successful resolution. A few of these reasons are outlined below to help you understand the issues with Apple ID:

### 1\. Incorrect Login Credentials

An inactive Apple ID results from incorrect login information. Mistyped passwords or forgotten Apple ID usernames can render the account inactive.

Apple employs strict security measures to protect user accounts. Sometimes, an Apple ID becomes inactive due to suspicious activities. This triggers security locks to safeguard sensitive information.

Unsettled payments, expired credit cards, or billing-related problems can lead to an inactive Apple ID. Failure to update payment information or resolve outstanding dues may cause this issue.

### 4\. Server or Network Problems

At times, issues with Apple's servers or network connectivity problems on your end can contribute to an inactive Apple ID. This may prevent proper authentication and verification, resulting in the inactivity of the account.

### 5\. Software Updates or Glitches

System updates or software glitches might also play a role in deactivating an Apple ID. Incompatibility issues can arise from software updates or glitches within the OS. These can interfere with the account's active status.
