Understanding the causes behind “ why **my Apple ID is not active**” is necessary for resolving it. Several factors contribute to this problem, requiring attention for a successful resolution. A few of these reasons are outlined below to help you understand the issues with Apple ID:

### 1\. Incorrect Login Credentials

An inactive Apple ID results from incorrect login information. Mistyped passwords or forgotten Apple ID usernames can render the account inactive.

### 2\. Account Security Measures

Apple employs strict security measures to protect user accounts. Sometimes, an Apple ID becomes inactive due to suspicious activities. This triggers security locks to safeguard sensitive information.

### 3\. Payment or Billing Issues

Unsettled payments, expired credit cards, or billing-related problems can lead to an inactive Apple ID. Failure to update payment information or resolve outstanding dues may cause this issue.

### 4\. Server or Network Problems

At times, issues with Apple's servers or network connectivity problems on your end can contribute to an inactive Apple ID. This may prevent proper authentication and verification, resulting in the inactivity of the account.
