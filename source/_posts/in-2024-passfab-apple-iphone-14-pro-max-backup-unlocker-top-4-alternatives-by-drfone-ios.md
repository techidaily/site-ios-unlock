Consider utilizing iTunes as a solution for the "iPhone Unavailable" issue. It involves the restoration of your device to its factory settings. While effective, note that it leads to complete data loss. Unlocking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Unavailable via iTunes is detailed in the following step-by-step guide:

- **Step 1.** Make certain your computer has the most recent version of iTunes installed. Afterward, connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to it via a USB cable. To place your device into Recovery Mode, refer to the appropriate guide based on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max model.
- **For iPhone 8 or Later:**Press the Volume Up button momentarily, followed by the Volume Down button similarly. Press the Side button until the recovery mode screen is displayed.
- **For iPhone 7 and 7 Plus**: Simultaneously press the Volume Down and Sleep/Wake buttons and hold them until the recovery mode screen comes up.
- **For iPhone 6s and Earlier:**Simultaneously press the Home and Sleep/Wake buttons until the recovery mode screen emerges.
