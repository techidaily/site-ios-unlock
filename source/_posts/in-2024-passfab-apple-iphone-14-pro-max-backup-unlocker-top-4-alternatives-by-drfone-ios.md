## Part 1. iPhone is Unavailable: Explaining the Basics

The "iPhone Unavailable" issue is a distressing fix encountered by users. It occurs when their **iPhone becomes unavailable with a black screen** and inaccessible due to many incorrect passcode attempts. This problem arises as a security measure implemented by Apple. Its primary aim is to protect the data on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and deter unauthorized access.

The iPhone's security mechanism typically activates after six wrong attempts. It starts with making the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max unavailable for a specific period.
