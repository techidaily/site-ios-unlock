## Apple iPhone 13 Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking? Here's the Fix

## Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?

When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!

In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.

![encrypt local backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg)

Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 13 backup unlocking never set by you.

But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let's talk about them.

## Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password

Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.

One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.

There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

### 1\. Try all passwords you use on iPhone

When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?

To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.

A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.

Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.

### 2\. Find the password from Keychain on macOS

You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.

The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.

1. On your macOS, go to **Utilities** by clicking the **Applications** menu item. At this point, launch the **Keychain Access app** and look for your Apple iPhone 13 backup.
2. To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.
3. On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 13 backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.

![keychain](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg)

### 3\. "Reset All Settings"

Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 13 backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.

Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:

**Step 1:** Unlock your Apple iPhone 13, and then open the **Settings** app on your device.

**Step 2:** After locating the **General** menu, go to the **Reset** menu and then hit the **Reset All Settings** button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 13.

![reset all settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.

**Step 4:** The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 13 using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.

You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.

**Step 1:** Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 using iCloud.

**Step 2:** After you have opened the **Settings** app, go to the **General** menu, then to the **Reset** menu, and finally to the **Erase All Content and Settings** option.

![reset in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg)

**Step 3:** Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 13 to factory settings, and wait until it is done.

**Step 4:** Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the **Apps & Data** option.

**Step 5:** Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.

You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 13 device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.

On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.

### 4\. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

**First step:** After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled **"Screen Unlock."**

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2:** While in the interface for **Screen Unlock**, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled **"Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption."** This will allow you to proceed.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3:** When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.

Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the **"Remove Now"** button:

- Check to ensure that **"Find My iPhone"** is not turned on.
- During this procedure, you should not launch **"iTunes."**
- During the process, your Apple iPhone 13 will restart.

![connected](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png)

**Step 4:** If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won't take a lot of time at all.

![checking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png)

**Step 5:** The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 backup never set in the first place!

![removed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png)


### The Bottom Line

There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone 13 backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 13. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to "Reset All Settings" on your Apple iPhone 13.

Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to avoid the problem of iTunes backup password never set.

## Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 13 with iTunes?

Just like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS), you can also use iTunes to fix the Apple iPhone 13 won’t unlock the problem. Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone's. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.

**Prerequisites**:

1. Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 13. You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.
2. Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13. Go to the iTunes menu, check for updates, and follow the simple on-screen instructions to update iTunes.

**Step 1. Put your phone in the Recovery Mode**

After meeting the basic prerequisites, you need to put your Apple iPhone 13 in recovery mode by following these steps:

1. Connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the system (Mac or Windows) and launch an updated version of iTunes on it.
2. Press the Volume Up key quickly. That is, press it only for a second and release it.
3. Similarly, quick-press the Volume Down key as well.
4. Once the Volume Down key is released, press the Side button.
5. Keep pressing the Side key until the connect-to-iTunes symbol would appear on the screen.

Make sure that all the key combinations should be pressed consecutively. That is, you should not take an evident pause in between.

![put iphone xs in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-1.jpg)

**Step 2. Restore Apple iPhone 13 in Recovery Mode**

As soon as your phone would enter the recovery mode, iTunes will detect an issue with your device and display the following prompt. Click on the “Restore” option and follow the simple on-screen instructions to reset your phone entirely.

![unlock iphone xs in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-2.jpg)

Once your phone would be restored, it will be turned on without any existing lock.

## Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone 13 without a passcode using iCloud?

Another way to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 13 without a passcode or Face ID is by using iCloud. Instead of turning off the Find my iPhone service, we will use it to erase the Apple iPhone 13 device remotely. Though, you should know your Apple ID and password to implement this technique.

1. Go to iCloud’s official website and log in with your Apple ID and password.
2. From here, click on the “Find my iPhone” service.
3. It will provide a list of all the Apple iPhone 13 devices linked to your Apple account. Select your Apple iPhone 13.
4. Click on the “Erase” button and answer the security question correctly to confirm your choice.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode in icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-3.jpg)

If you get a prompt on your phone regarding the respective actions, agree to it and wait for a while as your phone would be restarted. Since this will erase all the existing data on your phone, you can later use a backup file to restore the lost content.

## Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone 13?

Lately, there have been a lot of articles about this method. As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 13. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.

It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 13 that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 13 currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.

## Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 13 X/Apple iPhone 13 from being unlocked by thieves

It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 13 from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.

**5.1 Enable Find my iPhone**

This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.

Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.

**5.2 Use Find my Friends**

Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.

In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg)

**5.3 Enable two-factor authentication**

Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings > Apple ID > Passcode & Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.

**5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts**

This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.

Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.

![unlock iphone xs without passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg)

Out of all the provided options, [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is recommended.

## What Can I Do to Contact Its Owner?

Once the found iPhone is successfully unlocked, you can contact its owner in many ways.

Following are some of them that work.

### Contact the owner with the phone number in lost mode

Many iPhone owners habitually put their phone numbers in lost mode. So, you can check if any phone number is available in the lost mode. If a phone number is available, you can contact the owner and return the Apple iPhone 13 to them.

![contact the owner with the phone number in lost mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/i-found-an-iphone-how-do-i-unlock-it-6.jpg)

The rightful owner of the Apple iPhone 13 activates lost mode. You can see the lost mode on the notification panel, where a message will show that the phone is lost. The owner can also remotely lock the phone using this mode.

### Check medical ID in an emergency call

There is a feature in the Apple iPhone 13 known as medical ID. This feature can help you contact the owner of the found iPhone if they are unavailable.

![contact the owner with the help of emergency medical id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/i-found-an-iphone-how-do-i-unlock-it-7.jpg)

To do this, go to the emergency call screen and tap on the Medical ID option. Here, you can find out the name and phone number of the owner. So, you can use this information to contact the owner and return the iPhone.
