## Part 3: How to unlock iPhone passcode without iTunes using iCloud?

If your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is already in sync with iCloud and you have enabled the Find My iPhone feature, then you can easily learn how to unlock iPhone passcode remotely. The service was originally introduced to locate a lost iPhone. Though, it can also erase an iPhone entirely without much trouble. To learn how to unlock iPhone 6 passcode using iCloud, follow these steps:

1\. Visit the official website of iCloud and sign-in using your account credentials. This should be the same account that is in sync with your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

2\. On the home page, you will find various options. Click on “Find iPhone” to learn how to unlock iPhone 5 passcode.

## Part 4: How to unlock iPhone passcode by tricking Siri?

As you can see, in all the above-stated solutions, your Apple iPhone 6 Plus data would be lost. Therefore, we recommend trying this technique beforehand.

Nevertheless, you can give it a try and learn how to unlock iPhone 6 without a password by following these steps:

1\. Unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and press the Home button to activate Siri.

2\. Provide a command like “What time is it” to get the current time with the display of the clock icon.
