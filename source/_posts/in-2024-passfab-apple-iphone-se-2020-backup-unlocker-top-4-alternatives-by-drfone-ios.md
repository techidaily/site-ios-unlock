## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is locked or not:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

To check whether your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.

- **Step 1.** Firstly, open your Apple iPhone SE (2020) "Settings" and tap the "General" option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

- **Step 2.** After that, choose the “Carrier Lock" option to see the restrictions. If your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is unlocked, it will not show any SIM restriction. If you see the “SIM Locked” restriction, your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is locked.

![iphone is carrier locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-3.jpg)

### Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue

The “iPhone is Disabled” issue appears when you or anyone else enters the wrong passcode multiple times. In that case, Apple's security restricts you from entering the passcode for a specific time interval. After a while, it might permanently disable your Apple iPhone SE (2020) from being accessed through a passcode or any other direct security unlocking option. However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.
