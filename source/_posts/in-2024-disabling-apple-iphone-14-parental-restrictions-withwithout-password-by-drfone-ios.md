### Method 5: Unlock iPhone via Erase iPhone Features (iOS 15.2)

With iOS 15.2, Apple introduced the Erase iPhone feature, aiding users in resetting devices with forgotten passcodes.

**_Notice:_** _Before the Finder or iTunes restores your Apple iPhone 14, it will back up the Apple iPhone 14 data in iCloud. Thus, you can download the restored files after the Apple iPhone 14 device restarts._

Now, you have learned how to unlock a disabled iPhone with iTunes.
