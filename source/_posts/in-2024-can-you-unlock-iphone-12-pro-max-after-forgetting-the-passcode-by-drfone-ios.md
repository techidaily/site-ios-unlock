### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

## Part 1. Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking for Outlook Password

The **iPhone asking for Outlook password** arises from a combination of factors. Understanding these reasons is crucial in diagnosing and resolving the problem effectively:

### 1\. Incorrect Password Entry

Users might unknowingly enter the wrong password. They may have changed their Outlook password without updating it on their iPhones. This mismatch can trigger continuous password prompts.

### 2\. Outdated Mail App

An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

Upholding a stable internet connection is necessary for effortless communication. An unreliable or unstable network can disrupt the synchronization process in Outlook.

Other mail applications installed on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max can also cause an issue. They might interfere with the Outlook app's proper functioning. Identifying and temporarily disabling such apps can help diagnose and resolve the issue.

Configuring the Outlook mail app to fetch emails too frequently causes the issue. It can strain the connection with Outlook servers, leading to authentication challenges. That causes issues like the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max asking for a password.
