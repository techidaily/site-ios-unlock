## How to Unlock Apple iPhone 7 with a Mask On

Are you tired of wearing a mask in this pandemic? Apple introduced a new feature through which people can unlock **iPhone face ID while wearing a mask**.

However, this feature is only available on iOS 15.4, depicting that iPhones containing earlier iOS versions won’t be able to enjoy this feature.

Only iPhone 12 and the latest models can use Face ID with a mask on, which reflects that models like iPhone 11, iPhone X, and the older models cannot utilize this function. Moreover, an additional way to unlock iPhone is to use Apple Watch to unlock iPhone 11, X, or earlier models.

Once you meet these requirements, you can easily unlock your Apple iPhone 7 while wearing a mask and get further details by reading this article.
