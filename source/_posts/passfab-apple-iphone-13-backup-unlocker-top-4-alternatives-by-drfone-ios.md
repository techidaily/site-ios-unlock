### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 13 in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 13 device.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 passcode with iTunes:

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 13 and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 13 device. All data on the Apple iPhone 13 device will be deleted in the process. There is currently no way to unlock disabled iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 3: How to restore data via iCloud?

After unlocking the disabled iPhone, when you set it up again, if you previously had iCloud Backup enabled, you will get the option to restore data from the latest backup.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled In Future

By now, you know that should the Apple iPhone 13 be disabled for any reason, unlocking the disabled iPhone is a process that will wipe the Apple iPhone 13 device clean. And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?

A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.

If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.

### Conclusion

It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.

But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 13 gets disabled. How to unlock disabled iPhone? The ways outlined in this guide will help you unlock your disabled iPhone.
