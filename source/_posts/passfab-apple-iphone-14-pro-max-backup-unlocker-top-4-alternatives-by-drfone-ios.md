Still, the most reliable method to unlock your backup is to use a professional tool such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock, Passfab iPhone Backup Unlocker, or other iPhone backup unlockers. This group of software employs a sophisticated algorithm to figure out your password for you, and it has a high percentage of success.

An iPhone backup unlocker is software that, if you forget the password for your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, may assist you in regaining access to your device.

A brute-force assault is the most popular strategy for accomplishing this goal, while many other approaches may also work. To do this, one must iterate through every conceivable combination of letters and digits until one reaches the proper passcode.

If the password for an iPhone has been forgotten, this is often the only option to recover access to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, even though it may be time-consuming.

We are fortunate to have access to a wide variety of software applications that, when used together, may significantly streamline and simplify the process. So, let's talk about them!

**Step 1:** Go to <https://icloud.com> and sign in using the iCloud/ Apple ID used with the locked iPhone. If you use any other ID, you will not see this iPhone since it would not be attached to that ID.

### FAQ 1: Can I unlock iPhone without data loss?

Unlocking an iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device's contents as the entire device is wiped and the operating system is installed fresh. Therefore, there is no way to unlock iPhone without data loss.

### FAQ 2: Can I use iPhone without passcode?

Yes, you can use the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max without a passcode if you fear that you might forget the passcode again. However, this also means exposing your data and device to theft and security risks, not to mention that you will only be able to use Touch ID if you set up a passcode first.

## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

### Conclusion
