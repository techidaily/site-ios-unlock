## Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs

Despite your best efforts, there's always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.

They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That's why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:

- **Frequent Login Requests**

If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it's a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.

![apple id sign in request](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg)

- **Unexpected Purchases**

Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.

- **Password Reset Emails**

Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn't make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.

- **Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account**

Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.

- **Difficult Logging In**

To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.

## Part 2: How To Change Your Password on Apple ID on Different Devices?

But first, are you now wondering if your Apple ID password is strong enough? Or if it is even secure?

If so, you're not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it's still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover **how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account**, here are three things you should consider:

- **Complexity**

Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.

- **Uniqueness**

Be creative, and don't use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday. Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as "123456" or "password."

- **Length**

Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.

Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password. Read on to get to the heart of the matter – **how to change the password on Apple ID**. Doing it is easy; you can do it on your Apple iPhone XS, iPad, Mac, or the web.

It's a frustrating situation where you forgot your Apple iPhone XS's passcode and are now unable to unlock it. Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone XS, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone XS without a passcode.

There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone XS without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone's stock features like Find My Apple iPhone XS or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone XS lock screen.

So, let's get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone XS lock screen.

## 4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone XS without Passcode

Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone XS without a passcode:

### Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes

Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone XS passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.

![using itunes to unlock iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg)

Follow the steps to do this.

1. First, connect your Apple iPhone XS to your computer and launch iTunes. You will have to install it if you don't have it on your computer. For installation, [click here and download](https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes)
2. Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.
3. Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone XS's specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named **Restore iPhone**.
4. By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone XS, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone XS XR lock screen without any passcode.

### Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone

If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven't used iTunes before, we have another solution. You can use the "Find My iPhone" feature to erase your device and unlock it. This is useful when you quickly want to unlock your Apple iPhone XS without a passcode.

5. So provide them, and you will be able to erase your Apple iPhone XS, and in the end, your Apple iPhone XS will be unlocked without needing a passcode or password.

### Method #4: Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock
