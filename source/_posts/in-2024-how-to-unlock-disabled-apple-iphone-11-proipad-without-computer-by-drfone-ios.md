### Fix 9. Try Other Alternatives to Outlook

Exploring alternative mail applications may offer a viable workaround. This is especially true if the **iPhone asking for the Outlook password** proves resistant to previous solutions.

This solution might not directly resolve the issue with Outlook. Yet, an alternative can provide a temporary workaround until a solution is found.
