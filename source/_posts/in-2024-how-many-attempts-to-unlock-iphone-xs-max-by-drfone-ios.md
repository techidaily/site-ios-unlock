### Fix 2. Change the Password to Your Outlook Mail

Sometimes, the email service provider may force users to change their passwords for security reasons. There is a chance that it is why your **iPhone asks for an Outlook password**. To modify your Outlook password from the desktop platform, adhere to the following steps:

- **Step 1.** Open your preferred web browser and go to the Outlook login page. Sign in to your Outlook account, locate, and click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner. There, click "My Profile," and on the next screen, tap "Change Password" near the upper right corner.

![access my profile outlook web](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-4.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Upon reaching the verification page, provide your password and tap the "Sign In" button. Afterward, you will be asked for other verification methods. Upon verifying, the "Change your password" window will appear. Here, you will need to enter your "Current password," "New password," and re-enter it to proceed. Then, hit the "Save" button, and your password will be changed.

### Fix 3. Checking the Network Connection

[<u>Network inconsistencies</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-network-settings-iphone.html) can often disrupt the authentication process. This can be the leading cause behind persistent password prompts. To ensure a stable connection, ensure that you are connected to a reliable and stable Wi-Fi network. You can also try toggling the Wi-Fi and mobile data switches on and off.

Another way to confirm if network errors are the problem is to try enabling Airplane Mode. After a while, disable the Airplane Mode and check if the issue is resolved.

### Fix 4. Using the Mail Toggle as a Remedy

A strategic approach to resolving authentication issues involves using the Mail toggle. You can use it to disable and re-enable the email services. This action essentially resets the Outlook app's connection and can be performed as follows:

- **Step 1.** Within your Apple iPhone XS Max's "Settings" app, scroll down and tap "Mail." On the following screen, press "Accounts" and choose the "Outlook" account.

![proceed with outlook account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-7.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Here, you will find the toggle switch for "Mail." Now, turn off the email service and wait for a few moments. Toggle the switch back on to re-enable the email service.

![toggle on off mail switch](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-8.jpg)

### Fix 5. Delete and Re-Insert Outlook Account

Deleting and re-inserting your Outlook account on your Apple iPhone XS Max can provide a fresh start to the email integration. Follow these steps if the persistent **iPhone keeps asking for an Outlook password:**

- **Step 1.** Navigate to the "Mail" tab within the "Settings" app on your Apple iPhone XS Max, and choose "Accounts" to observe the roster of email accounts. Here, tap on your Outlook account, and the following screen, press "Delete Account."

![delete outlook account from mail](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-9.jpg)

![add outlook account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-10.jpg)

### Fix 6. Re-Check Sync Settings

Ensuring that your sync settings align with Outlook's recommended configurations is crucial. Follow these steps to re-check and adjust your sync settings on your Apple iPhone XS Max:

- **Step 1.** After accessing the "Mail" tab within the Settings app, tap "Accounts." Here, find and choose the "Fetch New Data" option, followed by selecting the "Outlook" account.

![manage outlook fetch data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-11.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Confirm that the "Push" or "Fetch" settings are configured to your preference. "Push" enables real-time updates, while "Fetch" allows you to set specific intervals for email updates.

![select required schedule for outlook](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-12.jpg)

### Fix 7. Uninstall and Re-Install Outlook App

Is the Outlook app generally showing a lot of glitches on your Apple iPhone XS Max? If yes, uninstalling and then re-installing it can address potential **“**iPhone**/iPad keeps asking for Outlook password”** issues:

**Instructions:** On your Apple iPhone XS Max's home screen, navigate to the Outlook mail app. Long-press the Outlook app icon and choose "Remove App" from the pop-up menu. Then, tap "Delete App" and follow it by pressing "Delete" to uninstall the app. Afterward, access the App Store and download the Microsoft Outlook app again.

![remove outlook app from device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-13.jpg)

### Fix 8. Update iOS From Settings

Outdated iOS versions can contribute to compatibility issues and glitches. This can affect the proper functioning of the Mail app and its integration with Outlook. Follow these steps to ensure your iOS is up to date:

**Instructions.** Access your device's "General" settings from the Settings app. Tap "Software Update" on the next screen and check if an update is available.

### Fix 9. Try Other Alternatives to Outlook

Exploring alternative mail applications may offer a viable workaround. This is especially true if the **iPhone asking for the Outlook password** proves resistant to previous solutions. Consider using other email platforms such as Apple Mail, [<u>Gmail</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/factory-reset-protection/bypass-gmail-phone-verification.html), and Yahoo Mail. This solution might not directly resolve the issue with Outlook. Yet, an alternative can provide a temporary workaround until a solution is found.

### Fix 10. Try Disabling Privacy Protection

Certain privacy protection features on your Apple iPhone XS Max may interfere with the integration of Outlook. To troubleshoot this, consider temporarily disabling privacy protection settings:

**Instructions.** On your Apple iPhone XS Max, access "Mail" settings through the Settings application. Now, scroll down to find and tap the "Privacy Protection" option in the "Messages" section. Next, you will come across the "Protect Mail Activity" switch. Here, toggle off the switch to check if it is resolved.

![manage privacy protection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/iphone-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-16.jpg)

### Fix 11. Reset All Settings of the iPhone

If the persistent password prompts remain unresolved, resetting all settings on your Apple iPhone XS Max can be the solution. It acts as a comprehensive solution to potential configuration issues. This action does not erase your data but resets system settings to default. To reset all settings on your Apple iPhone XS Max, you can follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Navigate to the "General" tab in the "Settings" app on your Apple iPhone XS Max after you open it. Move down the screen, and at the bottom, choose "Transfer or Reset iPhone."
