Such issues can worsen the condition.

Therefore, we have introduced some alternate ways to unlock your iDevice. You can even use an expert tool to remove this issue. Keep following us to find out more about our recommended methods.

### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 mini passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 12 mini in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 12 mini device.

It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.

Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won't be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen's passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 mini passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 12 mini, iPad, or iPod Contact.**

- **On iPhone 8/8 Or later:** Hold the Power/Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 12 mini transforms into the recovery mode screen.
- **On iPhone 7/7 Or Below:** Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 12 mini to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.

**Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 12 mini.**

After connecting your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, "There is an issue with the 'iPhone name' that needs it to be restored." In that window, select "Restore" to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn't run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)

**Step 3. Set up iPhone.**

Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 12 mini and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.

![erase iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg)

That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.

To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:

**Step 1.** Press and hold the "Home" button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 12 mini.

**Step 2.** Advise Siri to set a reminder.

## Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini with iTunes?

Just like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS), you can also use iTunes to fix the Apple iPhone 12 mini won’t unlock the problem. Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone's. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode.

**Prerequisites**:

1. Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 12 mini. You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.
2. Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13. Go to the iTunes menu, check for updates, and follow the simple on-screen instructions to update iTunes.

**Step 1. Put your phone in the Recovery Mode**

After meeting the basic prerequisites, you need to put your Apple iPhone 12 mini in recovery mode by following these steps:

## Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone 12 mini without a passcode using iCloud?

## Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone 12 mini?

Lately, there have been a lot of articles about this method. As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.

It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 12 mini that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 12 mini currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.

## Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 12 mini X/Apple iPhone 12 mini from being unlocked by thieves

If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.

**5.1 Enable Find my iPhone**

This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.

Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.

**5.2 Use Find my Friends**

Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.

In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.

**5.3 Enable two-factor authentication**

Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings > Apple ID > Passcode & Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.

**5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts**

This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.

Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.
