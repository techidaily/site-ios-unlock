Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

## Part 1: How to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without computer using Siri?

Accessing Siri is the first thing that comes to iOS users' minds whenever they [get locked out of their Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/get-into-locked-iphone.html). It might surprise you, but you can also take the assistance of Siri to unlock your phone. Most users prefer this technique, as it doesn’t require a computer and can unlock an iOS device without erasing its data.

Though, before you proceed, you need to know the limitations of this method. Since it is considered a loophole in iOS, it doesn’t always yield desirable results. It has been observed that the method only works on devices running from iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. To learn how to unlock iPad passcode without a computer, follow these stepwise instructions:

**Step 1.** Activate Siri on your iOS device by holding the Home button. Ask for the present time by giving a command like “Hey Siri, what time is it?” to proceed. Siri will let you know the current time by displaying a clock. Tap on it.
