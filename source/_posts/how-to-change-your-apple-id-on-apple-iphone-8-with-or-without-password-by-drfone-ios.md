## Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID

Your iOS devices contain most of your digital data. That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.

If you feel the existing Apple ID isn't secure enough, it's a good idea to **change your Apple ID on your iPad** or other devices. Aside from this, there are a few scenarios where you might find yourself needing to change your details:

You No Longer Use the Email Address or Phone Number Associated With Your Apple ID

Life moves fast, and sometimes contact info changes. If the email or phone number linked to your Apple ID becomes outdated, it's a good idea to update it. That way, you won't miss out on vital notifications or have trouble recovering your account if needed.

You Want To Simplify Your Online Life

If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.

You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country

Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.

Step 7: Select the firmware package after the download completes. After the download completes, you can click Unlock Now to start unlocking the Apple iPhone 8.

In a short while, your Apple iPhone 8 will be unlocked. It is important to note that unlocking a locked Apple iPhone 8 cannot be done without wiping data.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 8 with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 8, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 8 device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 8, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 8.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 8 and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 8 and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 8 was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone 8 in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone 8 using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 8 to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.
