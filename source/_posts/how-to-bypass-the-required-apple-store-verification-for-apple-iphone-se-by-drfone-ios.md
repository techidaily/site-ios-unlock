## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone SE

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone SE or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone SE or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In
