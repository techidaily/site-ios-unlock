## Unlocking Apple iPhone 6s  Lock Screen: 3 Foolproof Methods that Actually Work

[![drfone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

The competition in the market between Android and iOS has been increased ever since the features are increasing. People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.

Looking more into the Apple iPhone 6s world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 6s . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.

## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 6s  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 6s device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 6s device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 6s device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 6s  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

- **Step 3. Put iOS Into Recovery Mode and Specify Details**

Moving on, you must put your iOS device into Recovery Mode. For this, follow the instructions on the screen based on your Apple iPhone 6s model.

## Part 2. \[Old Ways\] Using Siri To Unlock Stolen iPhone

It might come as a surprise to you that Siri can be used to unlock a lost iPhone. When you seek the answer to **how to unlock a lost iPhone** with Siri, you need to be aware of a very specific pointer. It is necessary to note that this method only works for devices operating between iOS 8 and 11.

This later turned out to be an anomaly in Siri that led users to unlock their iOS devices. If you have a device running within this iOS version range, learn how to unlock it with the provided steps:

- **Step 1.** Start by activating the Siri on your iOS device. Ask a simple question about time, like "What time is it?" Once Siri is active, a clock will display on your device screen. Next, access the clock and find the “World Clock” screen on your Apple iPhone 6s. Tap the “+” button at the screen's top right corner. Enter the name of any city in the “Search Bar,” tap Select All, and choose “Share.”

![access world clocks via siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-6.jpg)

- **Step 2.** In the sharing options, look for "Messages." As you access the next screen, type anything in the "To" section and continue to select it by navigating to the "Create a New Contact" option. When providing the contact details, tap the "Add Photo" button. Lead into the Photos app from there and swipe up the screen or press the "Home" button to access the home screen.

## Part 3. \[All Data Lost\] Trying Recovery Mode for Unlocking Stolen iPhone

Another lifesaver method to unlock stolen iPhones is by utilizing the Recovery Mode. For this purpose, users need to connect their iPhones to their PC using [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/). Its ability to facilitate data restoration makes it an effective method to unlock iOS devices. Rather than searching for “**I bought a lost iPhone how do I unlock it**,” simply follow the instructions below:

- **Step 1.** Connect your locked stolen Apple iPhone 6s to the computer using a USB cable. To enter the Recovery Mode, you need to follow the steps below, depending on your Apple iPhone 6s model:

- **For iPhone 8 and Later:** Press and release the "Volume Up" button, followed by the "Volume Down" button. Press and hold the "Side" button on the right side of the Apple iPhone 6s device to activate Recovery Mode.
- **For iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:** Press and hold the "Volume Down" and "Side/Power" buttons to enable Recovery Mode in iPhone 7 models.
- **For iPhone 6 and Earlier:** To activate Recovery Mode, press and hold the "Home" and "Side/Power" buttons until the respective screen displays.

- **Step 2:** Once your Apple iPhone 6s is in Recovery Mode, iTunes will detect it automatically. A pop-up window will appear within iTunes to detect some problems with the Apple iPhone 6s device. Tap the "Restore" button to start the process and unlock your Apple iPhone 6s by erasing all settings and content.

## Part 4. Using Third-Party Unlocking Service To Unlock Stolen iPhone

In certain scenarios, when an iPhone gets stolen, it might enable the “Activation Lock.” This usually occurs to prevent the unauthorized access and usage of the Apple iPhone 6s device. When you face such a situation, third-party unlocking services can help you bypass the Activation Lock.

These services include [IMEIUnlockSIM](https://www.imeiunlocksim.com/unlock-phone/icloud-activation-lock-removal-services/), [IMEICHECK.CO](https://imeicheck.co/product/icloud-removal/) and [Apple iPhone Unlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/en_gb). Below, we have outlined steps for using Apple iPhone Unlock to help you with **how do I unlock a stolen iPhone** issue:

**Instructions:** First, access the Apple iPhone Unlock official website and enter the IMEI number of the Apple iPhone 6s device. Select the particular iOS device model and continue to select “Remove Activation Lock.” Following this, review the order summary and pay the fee with the required option. Upon successful completion of payment, the service will contact you for instant unlocking within 24 hours.
