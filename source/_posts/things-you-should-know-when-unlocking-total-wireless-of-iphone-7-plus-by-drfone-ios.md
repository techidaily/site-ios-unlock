## Part 4: How to get into a locked Apple iPhone 7 Plus with Siri?

If you don’t want to erase your device’s data while resolving this issue, you can use Siri. You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone 7 Plus by implementing the following steps:

**Step 1.** To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.

![hey siri](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491422339.jpg "hey siri")

**Step 2.** On the world clock interface, add another clock.
