## Part 1: What Will Happen When iPhone Is in Lost Mode?

The Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Lock feature permits remotely locking a lost Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to prevent people from using its data. If you set a password for a device before enabling the Lost Mode, you will need this password to unlock the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max once it has returned to its proprietor.

The Lost Mode menu will ask you to set one if it has no password. Password is obligatory to stop Lost Mode once a device is returned to the owner, as Contact ID or Face ID won't work for this reason.

**Send a Custom Text Message:** When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.

**Erase Data Remotely:** Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max if you believe it's been some time since it's gone and you don't think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.

**Track Your Device on Map:** An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.

**Play Songs:** Playing a sound might assist you with finding your lost iPhone if it's still close by. The Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max will play a sound at top volume, no matter what volume level was set on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device when you lost it.

## Part 4: Turn off Find My iPhone using Recovery Mode

The recovery model of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max allows you to reset or restore your data. It also offers data cleaning and backing up of apps to keep your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max updated and free of glitches. When your phone is lagging or not working properly, then you need to put it into Recovery Mode.

However, Recovery Mode can also be useful to turn off Find My iPhone on your device. Here are the steps that will guide you on how to turn off Find My iPhone on a broken phone using Recovery Mode.

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to your computer via cable and wait for your computer to detect your device.

**Step 2:** As soon as your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is detected, open iTunes and force restart your phone to activate the Recovery Mode. Activating this mode is different for different models of iPhone.

- For iPhone 8 and the later: Press the Volume Down button and release is immediately. Then press the Volume Up button and release it immediately again. After that, press and hold the Power Button until you see the Apple logo.
- For iPhone 7 and 7+: Press the Power Button and Volume Down button at the same time and hold them until the Apple logo appears on your screen.
- For iPhone 6s, and Previous Models: Press and hold the Home Button and Power button concurrently until your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max shows the Apple logo.

Once your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max shows the Apple logo, it means the Recovery Mode is activated.
