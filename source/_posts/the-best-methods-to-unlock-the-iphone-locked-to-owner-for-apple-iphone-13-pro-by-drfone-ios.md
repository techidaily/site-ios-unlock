## The Best Methods to Unlock the 'iPhone Locked to Owner' for Apple iPhone 13 Pro

Facing the "iPhone Locked to Owner" scenario can be hard as the fault doesn't lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an "****iPhone Locked to Owner****" can be a daunting task.

We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an "iPhone Locked to Owner." This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.

## Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock

Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here's a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:

![iphone to owner error](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg)

### Device Association

The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.

### Activation Lock Status

Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device's unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple's servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device's status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Locking Mechanism

If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device, preventing anyone from accessing the user's data. It also prevents device use without the owner's Apple ID and password.

### Device Recovery

In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device's screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.

### iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple's servers confirm the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device's activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner's Apple ID and password.

### Activation Lock on Used Devices

When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device will remain locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.

## Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Locked to Owner Security

Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner's security can be frustrating. That's why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to ****bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro locked to the owner for free****. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:

### Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device

If you've recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.

To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro:

- ****Step:**** Access your locked iPhone and tap "Unlock with Passcode." On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.

    ![tap unlock with passcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg)

### Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device Using iCloud

The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn't remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.

To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 13 Pro:

- ****Step 1:**** Access the iCloud website on your computer's browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the "Find My" option.

- ****Step 1:**** Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 13 Pro is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Settings to tap "Wi-Fi" and navigate to the "Choose Wi-Fi Network" option.

![use the dns method](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg)

### Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service

Siri is a voice assistant on Apple devices. Like other devices have Alexa and Google Assistant, iPhone has Siri. It empowers you to use the Apple iPhone 13 Pro through voice commands. You can converse with Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro password.

How might Siri unlock iPhone? One can use bugs in Siri to unlock iPhone. However, it is only possible in a few iOS versions.

**Step 1.** First and foremost, enable Siri. You should hold the home button of your locked iPhone and say 'Hello Siri' to enact her.

You need to ask Siri, "Siri, what time is it?" or "Siri, what time is it in the USA"? That will permit Siri to open the World Clock on your home screen.

**Step 2.** Presently, tap on the world clock symbol. Now, tap on the + sign in the upper right corner to add the clock feature to the home screen.

**Step 3.** At the point when another clock is added, you will have the choice to share the new clock.

**Step 4.** Click on the share button and Pick the Message choice.

**Step 5.** You don't need to text a message. Instead, add something arbitrary in the "To" field.

**Step 6.** Add Siri to make another contact by tapping on the new or + symbol. Siri will open the New Contact interface with details like adding the name, photo, etc.

**Step 7.** Add the photo from the photo library. Tap on "Add Photo," and it will open the library for you. Tap on Select Photo, and Siri will unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and let you pick a photo.

**Step 8.** When the photo library is open, tap on the home button or return button to get back to the unlock screen to get to the Settings symbol.

**Step 9.** When you open your settings, you can now refresh your credentials. This might work by making a Face ID rather than a password to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

Besides, it works for iPhones with iOS 8.0 to 10.1. These bugs are fixed in the later versions of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro and won't assist you with fooling Siri into unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.
