## Part 3. Working Methods To Unlock Apple Watch Without Passcode Perfectly

Apple Watch security features can manifest in various forms. Understanding these diverse forms of locks on your Apple Watch is essential. It allows you to employ specific operational methods to bypass these locks. Discussed below are three ways **how to unlock the Apple Watch without passcode**:

### Way 1. Unlock Apple Watch Activation Lock Using Third-Party Service

When faced with an Activation Lock on your Apple Watch, accessing the watch might seem challenging. Activation Lock is commonly triggered when the Apple iPhone 11 device is connected to an Apple ID and iCloud account.

Nevertheless, external services claim to provide solutions for bypassing the Activation Lock, specifically on Apple Watches. One such service is provided by Apple iPhone Unlock. These are the steps to bypass the Activation Lock on the Apple Watch:

- **Step 1.** Access the Apple iPhone Unlock website using a browser on another device. On the website, place the cursor on "Unlock iPhone" and choose "Apple Watch" from the drop-down menu.

![head to apple watch option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-watch-how-to-unlock-guide-6.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Choose your “Country,” along with the network service provider. Next, enter the [IMEI number](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-phone-free-with-imei-number.html) of your Apple Watch and click "Unlock for any SIM Card." Afterward, follow the prompts on the screen to complete the process.

### Way 2. Unlock the Apple Watch Lock by Resetting

If you forget your Apple Watch passcode without a paired device, a method to unlock the watch remains available. In this scenario, performing a reset becomes the answer to the question of **how to unlock Apple Watch without paired phone**. Place your watch onto its charger and keep charging until this process is complete. Follow these steps to reset your Apple Watch and bypass the lock:

- **Step 1.** Press and hold the "Side" button until the Power menu appears. As it appears, press and hold the "Digital Crown" button of your Apple Watch.

### Way 3. Unlocking Apple Watch Activation Lock by Contacting Previous Owner

Losing access to your Apple Watch goes beyond just forgetting the passcode; purchasing a used Apple Watch can also lead to being locked out. In this scenario, you can encounter an Activation Lock. Reaching out to the previous owner is a direct and often effective solution.

By contacting the previous owner, you can request them to remove the Apple iPhone 11 device from their iCloud account. Here's the procedure they can follow to unlock your Apple Watch, resulting in the Activation Lock bypass:

- **Step 1.** Access the [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) website via a web browser and sign in using the Apple ID. Click on the grid icon near the top right corner and select "Find My."

![access find my on icloud website](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-watch-how-to-unlock-guide-10.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Once there, choose your Apple Watch from the "All Devices" list. Opt for "Erase This Device" from the Apple iPhone 11 device's pop-up menu. Finally, adhere to the on-screen instructions to finalize the process.
