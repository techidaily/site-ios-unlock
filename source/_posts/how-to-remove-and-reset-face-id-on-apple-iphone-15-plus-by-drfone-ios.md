Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn **how to remove Face ID** on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.

## Part I: What is Face ID?

![face id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

If the new Apple iPhone 15 Plus is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 15 Plus from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 15 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 15 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 15 Plus 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

## Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus 13/12/11 with Face ID:

### II.I Unlock Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus

As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to [unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus 13](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-an-iphone-13.html)/iPhone 12/iPhone 11 with a look. How to do that? Here are the steps:

![an apple aard in wallet app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg)

Step 3: Look at your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### II.V Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![animojis and memojis](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

## Part 5. What To Do When iCloud Activation Lock Active?

Although IMEI Unlocking turns out to be quite an exceptional service, it generally is not the only thing that becomes a barrier for iPhone users. The iCloud Activation binds an Apple device to a user's Apple ID, making itself a great security measure. It presents a unique circumstance where services such as **doctorSIM legit** are inapplicable. [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) specializes in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock.

It allows users to circumvent it without needing the Apple ID. This unique capability sets Dr.Fone apart from other solutions. Once the activation lock is removed, it grants full access to users' devices. Dr.Fone also extends its capabilities to remove an Apple ID in cases where the password is forgotten. Its remarkable performance includes the permanent bypass of the Apple ID lock.

#### 1\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1

- **Step 1. Installation and iCloud Activation Lock Removal**

Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the "Toolbox" tab, navigate to "Screen Unlock" and select "iOS."
