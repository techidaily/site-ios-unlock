Now, lock the Apple iPhone 15 screen and then wake the Apple iPhone 15 device without looking at it.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we have explored different ways to **unlock iPhones without swiping up** beyond just using the usual swipe-up method. We've talked about using your fingerprint or face to unlock, using voice commands or special controls. The swipe-up gesture on iPhones is great, but these other methods give you more options.

While these methods are helpful, there's a software called Wondershare Dr.Fone that's particularly useful for iPhone issues. It does things like recovering data, fixing problems with your phone, and unlocking it when you can't get in. Dr.Fone has a feature called "Screen Unlock" that was specifically made to help with different ways of unlocking iPhones.
