![iphone blacklisted](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/comprehensive-guide-iphone-blacklist-removal-02.jpg)

### Why Does an iPhone Get Blacklisted?

There are a few reasons why an iPhone might end up on this digital naughty list:

- **Lower Resale Value.**If you ever decide to sell your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, its value will drop if it's blacklisted. People are wary of buying blacklisted phones because they come with limitations.

### Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal

The **iPhone blacklist removal** method is relatively easy. Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Contact the Original Owner**

One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 7 Plus ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.

**Option 2: Contact Your Carrier**

Your next option is to contact your carrier for an **iPhone blacklist removal service**. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.

If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device due to past-due account payments.

### Check the iPhone's History Before Buying

Before you hand over your hard-earned money, check the iPhone's background. Make sure it's not reported as lost or stolen. You can do this by asking the seller for the phone's IMEI or serial number and checking it online or with your carrier. A clean history is a green light to go ahead with the purchase.

### Keep Your Apple iPhone 7 Plus Secure

Just like you lock your front door, secure your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Use a strong passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID to protect your phone from unauthorized access. This simple step can prevent it from being misused and reported as stolen.

### Pay Your Bills on Time

Your iPhone needs its "phone allowance" paid on time, too. Ensure you pay your monthly bills to your carrier. Unpaid invoices can lead to your Apple iPhone 7 Plus getting blacklisted.

### Be Careful With iCloud

iCloud is like a protective bubble for your Apple iPhone 7 Plus's data. Don't share your Apple ID and password with just anyone. If someone else has access to your iCloud account and does something shady, it can affect your Apple iPhone 7 Plus's status.

- **Step 5:** Because this technique requires you to jailbreak your iOS device, you will be prompted to do so first. Click on **Jailbreak Guide** if you wish to follow a guide. If you want to follow a video guide instead, click on **Watch Video**.
- **Step 6:** After that, the screen will prompt you to conduct a series of actions, beginning with removing the SIM card from the iDevice. Continue to **Settings,** then **WLAN**, to access the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device's network settings. Locate the Wi-Fi networks you have joined and select **Forget This Network**. Remove all linked networks from **My Networks** and disable Wi-Fi. After that, re-insert your SIM card and tap **Continue**.
