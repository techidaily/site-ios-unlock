## Part 3. Set Up the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device Again Using the Security Lockout Procedure

Security Lockout or “iPhone Unavailable” happens when you attempt a wrong passcode 10 times. From there, you need to erase all your Apple iPhone SE (2020) data to regain access to the iOS device again.

While there is no direct way to regain access to your device when its passcode changes, you will have to [perform a factory reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html) on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to make it reusable. For that, look through the comprehensive guide on how to take your device out of this state:

- **Step 2.** To start the Apple iPhone SE (2020) reset, you need to tap on the “Start iPhone Reset.” Then, enter your Apple ID password in the given box and sign out your Apple ID. If you have an eSIM, you will be prompted with an option. Select the "Keep eSIM and Erase Data" or the "Delete eSIM and Erase Data" option according to your choice.

![use security unlock option to unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/unlock-iphone-passcode-changed-itself-6.jpg)

In another case, Apple allows you to temporarily sign in to your Apple iPhone SE (2020) using a recently changed passcode within 72 hours. But once you get into your device, set a new passcode immediately to retain your full access.

## Part 4. Using iTunes To Set Up iOS Device Again
