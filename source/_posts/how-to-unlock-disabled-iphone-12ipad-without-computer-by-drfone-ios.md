![iphone lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?

You can't remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn't currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.

Find out the steps below.

Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake

Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 12 screen with a simple tap. It's handy, but there's a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don't want any unexpected brightness.

Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to **remove the flashlight from lock screens**. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won't light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.

Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** or **General** > **Accessibility** on your Apple iPhone 12 device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off **Tap to Wake**.

![iphone turn off tap to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake

With "Raise to Wake" enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 12. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you'll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.

Here is **how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens** when not needed:

- **Step 1:** Head to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off the **Raise to Wake** option.

![iphone turn off raise to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center

The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and navigate to **Control Center**.
- **Step 2:** Tap on **Customize Controls**, then find the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 3:** Tap the red minus (**\-**) sign next to the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Remove** to confirm deleting the **Flashlight** icon from the **Control Center**.

![remove flashlight from iphone control center](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut

Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 12 lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone's back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.

Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won't accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here's how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Touch** > **Back Tap**.
- **Step 2:** Select the **Double Tap** or **Triple Tap** option you're using for the flashlight shortcut.
- **Step 3:** Choose **None** instead of the currently assigned action, which might be ****Flashlight****.

## Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?

Now, let's address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 12. Even if you've applied Part 1's solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you'll learn **how to turn the light off on iPhone** devices.

Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center

This method is fast and convenient, especially if you've kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.

Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight

To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight.

- **Step 1:** Say **"Hey Siri"** or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Give the commands saying, **"Turn off the flashlight."**
- **Step 3:** Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You'll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.

## Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?

Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12, it's crucial to understand, "**What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone**?" While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you'll learn both aspects.

Benefits of Jailbreaking

Apple's App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12:

- **Install Unapproved Apps**

Apple's App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.

- **Increased Customization Options**

Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.

![circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg)

- **Unlocking System-wide Features**

Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren't in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 12 based on your preferences.

- **Unlocking Network Restrictions**

Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 12 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.

However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.

Risks of Jailbreaking

While jailbreaking itself isn't illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple's security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**

Bypassing Apple's security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.

- **Voided Warranty**

Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won't cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.

- **Instability and Performance Issues**

Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in [<u>crashes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html), [<u>freezes</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html), or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 12's performance.

![iphone apps crashing message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg)

- **Difficulty in Updating**

Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.

- **Bricking Risk**

Incorrect jailbreaking can "[<u>brick</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html)" your Apple iPhone 12, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.

## Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?

Jailbreaking an iPhone won't remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device's system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here's how they differ:

- **Jailbreak**

**If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12, what happens** is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.

- **iCloud Activation Lock**

iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 12 to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.

While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can't override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/), leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.
