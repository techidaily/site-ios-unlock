## How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 12 mini

The Apple App Store is a familiar place for anyone with an iPhone or iPad. It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.

It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the **Apple Store “Verification Required”** prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.

![verification required page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?

When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 12 mini or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.

The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.

What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or [<u>Touch ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html) if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.

![verification required notification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg)

### Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear

There are several reasons why you might see an **Apple Store’ Verification** **Required**’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:

- **New Apple ID**. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.
- **Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.
- **Invalid credit card**. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.
- **Unpaid balance**. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.
- **Family Sharing restrictions**. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.

Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.

## Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID

Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:

### Update Payment Method

One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 12 mini or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the **Settings app**, then go to **Payment & Shipping**. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.

### Check Unpaid Subscriptions

Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store > your profile icon, and select **Subscriptions**. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.

![subscriptions page app store](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg)

### Don’t Require Password for Purchases

For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to **Screen Time**. Under **Content & Privacy Restrictions**, select **iTunes & App Store Purchases**. Here, you can change the settings to **Don’t Require** for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.

![screen time app store purchases](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg)

### Method 2: Using iTunes To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

An alternative method to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 mini when locked or disabled involves using iTunes. Note that if your iTunes is not synchronized with the iPhone, you risk losing your existing data. Here's how:

- **Step 1**: Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your locked iPhone using a cable and let iTunes identify the Apple iPhone 12 mini device. Next, navigate to the **Summary** section and select the **Restore iPhone** option.

![itunes main window](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-10.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Allow iTunes to identify your device. Start the restoration of previous data by selecting **Restore Backup**. Your Apple iPhone 12 mini will be unlocked with all the associated data if you have backed up your information on iTunes. Otherwise, you will need to set it up as a new iPhone.

### Method 3: Using Recovery Mode To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone

Activating Recovery mode is another useful method for accessing a locked phone. The approach erases all data on the phone, restoring it to factory settings. Any data not backed up will be lost using this method. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini with a USB cable.
- **Step 2**: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button. If executed, the iTunes connect screen will appear. For earlier iPhone models, you can refer to [<u>here</u>](https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/iphone/iph8903c3ee6/15.0).

![iphone hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-11.jpg)

- **Step 3:** iTunes will prompt you to either restore or update your Apple iPhone 12 mini. Choose the **Restore iPhone** option to reset your device to its factory settings. If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 12 mini exits recovery mode, you'll need to repeat the steps.

### Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone

After **many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 12 mini**，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.

![icloud all devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Select **All Devices**, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu. Once you've chosen the Apple iPhone 12 mini device, click the **Erase iPhone** icon in the lower-right corner. Although the action deletes the data on the phone, you can retrieve it from your iCloud backup once the Apple iPhone 12 mini device is operational again.

### Method 5: Contact Apple Support or Visit an Apple Store

If all methods fail or you don't have access to Dr.Fone, consider contacting Apple Support. You can also try visiting an Apple Store. Apple experts will guide you through the appropriate steps based on your unique situation.

## Conclusion

If you are wondering **how many passcode attempts on iPhone** will lock your device and not sure how to fix this issue, here is the way to go. Methods like iTunes, Recovery Mode, iCloud, or seeking Apple Support all offer potential solutions.

Consider using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) for a secure and data-preserving unlock. It safeguards your data even if you forget your passcode. Remember that surpassing the allowed attempts could result in data loss or permanent device disablement. Safeguard your data wisely by exploring these methods.
