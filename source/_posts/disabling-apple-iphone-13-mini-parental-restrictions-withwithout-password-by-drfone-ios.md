**Changing your Apple ID on your iPad** can be a great way to protect your privacy and security. However, it's important to take steps to ensure that your iOS data remains safe during the process. Here are some tips to help you do just that:

- **Backup Your Files**

Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.
