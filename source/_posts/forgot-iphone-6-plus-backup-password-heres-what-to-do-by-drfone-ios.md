## Forgot Apple iPhone 6 Plus Backup Password? Here's What to Do

![forget backup password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password

The Apple iPhone 6 Plus is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.

Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).

**Note:**

The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.

So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.

**To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:**

**Step 1:** Open iTunes

Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.

**Step 2:** Link your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your PC

At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.

**Step 3:** Begin the Encryption Process

Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.

![encryption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** Create a Password

When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.

After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.

## Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password

### 1\. Try all passwords you used on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus

The typical method that each individual attempts for the first time is to input all of the available passcodes. Even if it is the most straightforward technique, there is still a possibility that you miss one of them. Therefore, think about all of the passwords you may input, which are listed below.

- The password to log in to the computer
- The password to access Apple ID
- The password to access the encrypted data on the hard disk
- The password to access various websites
- The password to log in to the computer

### 4\. Select "Back Up Now" via iCloud to remove password

If you already have a backup stored in iCloud, you may use iCloud for recovery.

First, power up the gadget and look for the "Hello" screen. If you have previously set up your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you must delete or remove all of the material before continuing.

Navigate to the **Apps & Data menu** and choose the **Restore from iCloud Backup** option.

After successfully signing in with your Apple ID, choose **Backup**.

## Part 3: 3 Tricks to Help You Remember the Passwords

If you have an iPhone, you know it can be tricky to keep track of all your passwords. From your email password to your banking login, there are a lot of different codes to remember.

Here are three tricks to help you keep track of your passwords so you don't have to stress the next time you can't log in to your account.

1. Turn on "AutoFill" in "Settings"

You can turn on **AutoFill** in the **Settings** app. This will allow your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to fill in passwords when you visit websites and apps automatically. All you need to do is ensure you've entered the correct username and password once, and your Apple iPhone 6 Plus will save the information, so you don't have to enter it again.

![autofill](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-8.jpg)

2. Try iCloud Keychain to keep your passwords

iCloud Keychain is a great way to keep all your passwords in one place. Once you've turned on the iCloud Keychain, all your passwords will be synced across your devices. That means if you create a new password on your laptop, it will automatically appear on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

3. Use Notes for passwords

If you're finding a simple way to keep all your passwords, try using the Notes app. Create a new note and title it "Passwords." Then, add it to the note whenever you create a new password.

You can even add a description of the password, so you remember which account it's for.

### The Bottom Line

As a last piece of advice, please safely save your newly created passwords. Rather than writing them down in the iPhone's notepad, you should save the passwords in a secure location.

However, no matter how secure your gadget is, password leakage may happen, sending you to unpleasant situations that you can't even conceive. It's best to use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock as soon as you encounter any problem!

While you can't remove it, figuring out **how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens** is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device's battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus's lock screen and make it work better for you.

![iphone lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?

You can't remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn't currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.

Find out the steps below.

Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake

Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 6 Plus screen with a simple tap. It's handy, but there's a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don't want any unexpected brightness.

Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to **remove the flashlight from lock screens**. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won't light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.

Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** or **General** > **Accessibility** on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off **Tap to Wake**.

![iphone turn off tap to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake

With "Raise to Wake" enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you'll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.

Here is **how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens** when not needed:

- **Step 1:** Head to **Settings** > **Display & Brightness** on your iOS device.
- **Step 2:** Toggle off the **Raise to Wake** option.

![iphone turn off raise to wake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center

The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app and navigate to **Control Center**.
- **Step 2:** Tap on **Customize Controls**, then find the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 3:** Tap the red minus (**\-**) sign next to the **Flashlight** icon.
- **Step 4:** Tap **Remove** to confirm deleting the **Flashlight** icon from the **Control Center**.

![remove flashlight from iphone control center](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg)

Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut

Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone's back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.

Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won't accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here's how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Accessibility** > **Touch** > **Back Tap**.
- **Step 2:** Select the **Double Tap** or **Triple Tap** option you're using for the flashlight shortcut.
- **Step 3:** Choose **None** instead of the currently assigned action, which might be ****Flashlight****.

![setup iphone back tap to none](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg)

## Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?

Now, let's address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Even if you've applied Part 1's solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you'll learn **how to turn the light off on iPhone** devices.

Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center

Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight

To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight.

- **Step 1:** Say **"Hey Siri"** or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.
- **Step 2:** Give the commands saying, **"Turn off the flashlight."**
