iTunes service allows you to reset your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to factory settings and unlock the screen lock if **the Apple iPhone 14 Plus passcode changes on its own**.

If you can compromise losing data, you can follow these instructions to remove the Apple iPhone 14 Plus Passcode Changed Itself issue using iTunes:

**Instructions.** Firstly, launch iTunes on your desktop and connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. Then, you need to progress into putting your Apple iPhone 14 Plus in the [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263?at=1l3vrSk&ct=3e7454cbe7984ec49e91a8ace8e4198f).

## Part 5. Using iCloud To Set Up iOS Device Again

Using iCloud to unlock iOS devices is a safe and recommended method, but it also leads to complete data loss.

Also, you need to be aware of your Apple ID and password before proceeding. Follow this comprehensive guide step-by-step to set up your iOS device again using iCloud.

- **Step 1.** First of all, open iCloud on your desktop web browser. Afterward, enter your “Apple ID” and “Password” to proceed. After trusting the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, look for the "Grid" icon on the top right to find the "Find My" option in the list.
