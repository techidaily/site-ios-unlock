## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone X

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone X, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone X:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone X leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone X itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone X device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone X/Apple iPhone X mini/Apple iPhone X Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone X now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone X range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone X range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone X range builds on the Apple iPhone X 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone X 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone X lineup. the Apple iPhone X lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone X lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone X mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone X models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone X models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone X mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone X 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone X is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone X and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone X. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone X for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone X and unlocking it.
