**Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode**

Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone 14 Plus lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can't actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.

**Step 3. Affirm iOS device information**

After putting the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.

**Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Plus screen lock**

After the firmware is downloaded effectively, click Unlock Now to begin unlocking your Apple iPhone 14 Plus/iPad.

Simply shortly, your Apple iPhone 14 Plus will be unlocked effectively. Note that this unlocking process will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. However, it is practical to erase this issue from your device.


## Part 3: How Can I Turn Off/On My Passcode?

- Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu. On iPhones with a home button, this will be named "Fingerprint and Password." On new ones, it is "Face ID and Password." Click this choice.
- Enter your current password.
- Look down until you track the "Turn Passcode Off" choice and tap it.
