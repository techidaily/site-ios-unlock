### 2\. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes

How to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device.

Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn't so hard. Here's how to bypass the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max passcode with iTunes:

**Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPad, or iPod Contact.**
