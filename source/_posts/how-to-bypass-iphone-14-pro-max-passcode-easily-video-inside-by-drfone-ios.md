### 3.2 Apple iCloud Feature

iCloud is a multifunctional drive compatible with iOS and macOS. It saves your data, your media and organizes your files in folders.

The major feature of Apple iCloud is its ‘Backup’ which stores all your data in case you lose or damage your phone.

To fix the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max passcode, which is not working, iCloud can come in handy. But this method can only work if you've logged in to your iCloud account on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and your "Find My iPhone" application is turned on.
