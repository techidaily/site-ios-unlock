## How to Unlock Apple iPhone SE, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone SE. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone SE with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone SE is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone SE Locked?

In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone SE does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

## Part 5: How to Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Using Siri

If you do not have any potential source for unlocking your Apple iPhone SE, you can consider using Siri for this purpose. Here are the steps to bypass the Apple iPhone SE lock screen using Siri.

**Step 1:** You need to activate Siri on your Apple iPhone SE. Keep holding the Home button or Side button according to your Apple iPhone SE model for activating it. When activated, speak “What time is it” to it.

**Step 2:** Siri will display the time with a clock icon on the front. Click on the icon to open the associated interface. Click on the “+” icon and proceed to the next screen. You will find a search box on the next screen. Type random characters and hold the tab until it shows the option of “Select All.”

**Step 3:** You will find the option of the “Share” button soon. A pop-up opens after tapping on the button, which shows different options that can be accessed. Click on “Messages” to move to the next screen.

**Step 4:** Fill out the “To” box with some characters and click on “Return” on your keyboard. You need to press the Home button or swipe up according to your Apple iPhone SE model. The home page of your Apple iPhone SE will be accessed successfully.

**Pros**

- You do not need to access any other third-party tool for unlocking your Apple iPhone SE.

**Cons**

- If you have a version of iOS except **3.2 and 10.3.3**, you cannot use this method.
- This method is not applicable if Siri is not activated across your Apple iPhone SE.

## Part 6: FAQs about iPhone Screen Lock

1. **How many counts do I have to unlock my iPhone?**

You have around ten entries to unlock your Apple iPhone SE, after which the Apple iPhone SE device will be completely locked. After the 5<sup>th</sup> wrong entry, you are expected to wait for a minute until you try again. After the 10<sup>th</sup> wrong entry, the Apple iPhone SE device gets locked out and allows you to connect to iTunes.

2. **Is it possible to reset the Apple iPhone SE passcode with an Apple ID?**

No, you cannot reset the Apple iPhone SE passcode using Apple ID. Both are different security measures and cannot reset one using another.

Parental controls on iPhones use a different passcode to restrict content. It includes restricting things like privacy, game center, web content, explicit content, iTunes app and purchases. It is also known as a restriction passcode.

4. **Can Apple reset a forgotten iPhone passcode?**

No, Apple cannot reset the forgotten iPhone passcode. However, they will help you with the steps to erase, reset, and recover the phone. You must prove yourself to be the Apple iPhone SE device owner, so keep the purchase receipt with you.
