#### 1\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 12.0 to 14.8.1

- **Step 1. Installation and iCloud Activation Lock Removal**

Install and launch the most recent version of Wondershare Dr.Fone onto your computer. Now, proceed to the "Toolbox" tab, navigate to "Screen Unlock" and select "iOS." In the following window, choose "iCloud Activation Lock Removal" and click "Start" to begin the process and receive a prompt to connect your iOS device. Once connected, the window will display the progress status.

- **Step 2. Device Identification and Unlock Initiation**

Now, decide whether your device is GSM or CDMA, as it is an important aspect. Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device won't affect the Apple iPhone 12 device. However, running this process on a CDMA device will result in a loss of cellular activities. Click "Unlock Now" to proceed further, and if your device is CDMA type, you'll encounter a series of pointers. Go through them and click "Got It!" after agreeing with all the mentioned points.

- **Step 3. Jailbreaking and Activation Lock Bypass**

After this, if your iDevice isn't jailbroken, you will be required to jailbreak your device. For that, you can follow the step-by-step textual instructions or watch a video. Once the Apple iPhone 12 device is jailbroken, the process will commence automatically to bypass the Activation Lock. A completion message will pop up on the window when the process finishes. Afterward, tap the “Done” button to finalize the process successfully.

#### 2\. For Devices Running iOS/iPadOS 15.0 to 16.3

- **Step 1. iCloud Activation Lock Removal Setup**

On accessing the “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” page, a notification will display on the screen, alerting the user about the ongoing process. Carefully review all the information provided and select the "I have read and agree to the agreement" option. Proceed by tapping on the "Got It!" choice.

- **Step 2. DFU Mode Initiation and Device Unlock**

Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the [DFU Mode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/dfu-mode/tools-for-iphone-to-enter-dfu-mode.html) for your iOS device. Once in the particular mode, the program will send an initial command to the Apple iPhone 12 device, prompting it to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed and repeat putting the iOS device in DFU Mode. Likewise, upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 12 device promptly. Finally, click the "Got It!" button to conclude the process.

![read agreement and agree](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-13.png)

- **Step 3. Completion of iCloud Activation Lock Removal**

After processing the Apple iPhone 12 device in DFU Mode, Dr.Fone initiates the iCloud Activation Lock removal process. Monitor the progress bar to witness the process's completion. Once finished, a completion message will appear on the screen. Click “Done” to finalize the removal of the iCloud Activation Lock.
