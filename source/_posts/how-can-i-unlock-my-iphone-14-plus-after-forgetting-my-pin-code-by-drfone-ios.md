### Method 4: Unlock Your Apple iPhone 14 Plus Without Swiping Up via AutoUnlockX

AutoUnlockX is a tweak designed for jailbroken iPhones. It enhances the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device's unlocking experience by automatically bypassing the lock screen. That is when certain conditions are met. Jailbreaking involves bypassing the software restrictions imposed by Apple. Here are the steps to **iPhone 11 unlock screen without swiping**:

**Step 1.** Begin by adding an external repository like Sileo or Cydia, which will serve as an emulator. Remember, it won't be automatically added to your applications; you'll need to do this manually. So, download the repository from the [SparkDev](https://www.sparkdev.me/) website (it's not available on the App Store). Head to the "Tweaks" tab, find "AutoUnlockX," and download it to your device.

**Step 2.** Following this, go to "Sources" in your Apple iPhone 14 Plus's Settings, select "Edit," and manually add the external repo to Cydia or Sileo. Open Sileo or Cydia and navigate to the "Search" page. In the search bar, type "AutoUnlockX." Once the tweak appears, select it, and then tap "Get (Sileo)" or "Install (Cydia)."

**Step 3.** Confirm the selected repo by tapping the "Confirm" option and allow the tweak to install. Once installed, tap "Restart SpringBoard" to complete the download. After your Apple iPhone 14 Plus resprings, proceed to enable AutoUnlockX.

**Step 4.** Open Settings, tap on "App," and then select "AutoUnlockX." Toggle on "Enable Auto Unlock." Customize other settings as desired by tapping on them to turn them on or off.

**Step 5.** When finished, tap the "Respring" option at the bottom to apply your changes. At last, unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus using your Face ID effortlessly.

### Method 5: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up via Voice Control

Utilizing Voice Control to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus offers a hands-free approach to accessing your device. It is especially helpful for individuals with accessibility needs. There are situations where manual interaction might be challenging. Here's a guide on how to set up and use “Voice Control” to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:

**Step 1.** Open the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and scroll down to tap “Accessibility.” On the following screen, press “Voice Control” to proceed further.

### Method 6: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up with Switch Control

Utilizing Switch Control is an excellent accessibility feature on iOS devices. It allows users to interact with their iPhones using adaptive switches or the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device's screen itself. Moreover, it can provide an alternative way to navigate the Apple iPhone 14 Plus and access the Home screen. You no longer have to rely solely on the conventional swipe gesture. Here is how you can set up switch control to **iPhone swipe to unlock**:

**Step 1.** Access your Apple iPhone 14 Plus's Settings, then tap on "Accessibility." Now find and select "Switch Control," and within it, navigate to "Switches." Now, tap "Add New Switch" and choose "Camera."

![remove existing recipes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-9.jpg)

![reduce dwell time as needed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-10.jpg)

**Step 4.** Save your switch, return to Accessibility Settings, and locate “Accessibility Shortcut.” Now, set triple-clicking the side button to activate “Switch Control.” On the home screen, triple-click the Side button, as previously set, to activate the switch on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.
