You only need to wait for some time as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don't interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your Apple iPhone XS.

Once the process is completed, your Apple iPhone XS will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.

This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your Apple iPhone XS passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.


## How Can I Turn On/Off the Passcode on My iPhone?

If you want to turn the Passcode ON your Apple iPhone XS, then follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Go to 'Settings' and select 'Touch ID & Passcode' (if you're using an iPhone with Touch ID). If you're using an iPhone without a Touch ID, select 'Passcode.'

**Step 2:** Enter your current Passcode when prompted.

**Step 3:** Scroll down and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'ON' position.

**Step 4:** Enter a new 6-digit passcode when prompted. Then, please enter it again to confirm.

That's it! Your Passcode is now turned ON, and your device is more secure than ever.

To shut down the Passcode on your Apple iPhone XS, follow the steps above and toggle the 'Passcode' switch to the 'OFF' position.
