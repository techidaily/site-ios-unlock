## Part 1. Why Does My iPhone Keep Asking for Outlook Password

The **iPhone asking for Outlook password** arises from a combination of factors. Understanding these reasons is crucial in diagnosing and resolving the problem effectively:

Users might unknowingly enter the wrong password. They may have changed their Outlook password without updating it on their iPhones. This mismatch can trigger continuous password prompts.

### 2\. Outdated Mail App

An outdated Outlook mail app on your Apple iPhone XS Max may struggle to communicate with its latest security protocols. This can lead to performance issues like the Apple iPhone XS Max keeps asking for passwords.

### 3\. Network Connectivity Issues

The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone XS Max is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone XS Max Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone XS Max is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone XS Max from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone XS Max, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone XS Max and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone XS Max does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone XS Max with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max remotely if you want to.

Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone XS Max device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone XS Max, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone XS Max.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone XS Max and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone XS Max and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone XS Max was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone XS Max in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone XS Max using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone XS Max to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.
