**Step 4:** After scanning your face twice, select "Add Glasses" by tapping on it. You can use your Face ID while wearing your regular glasses. Make sure that you scan your face with every pair of glasses daily.

After carefully following the steps mentioned above, you are ready to **unlock your Face ID with a mask**. Remember that Face ID will scan and focus mainly on your eyes and forehead. However, it cannot work in the scenarios if you have completely concealed your look by wearing hats or accessories that can hide your face.

## Part 2: How to Unlock iPhone Face ID Using Apple Watch

Before unlocking iPhone through the Apple Watch, some requirements are necessary for security reasons. Read the following requirements to proceed further:

- First, you would need an Apple Watch that must be functioning on WatchOS 7.4 or later.
- The passcode on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) must be enabled from the settings. If you have not enabled the passcode on your Apple iPhone SE (2022), you can do it by navigating to the "Settings" and tapping on "Passcode." From there, enable the passcode by turning it on.
- You should be wearing the Apple Watch on your wrist, and it must be unlocked.
- Your Apple iPhone SE (2022) should be upgraded to iOS 14.5 or above.
- The wrist detection on your phone should be activated.

To enable the feature of unlocking the Apple iPhone SE (2022) with an Apple Watch, the steps are:

**Step** **1:** Head to the " Settings " app and choose "Face ID & Passcode." Give your passcode for authenticity and proceed further.

**Step** **2:** Now, on the displayed menu, scroll down to the bottom, where you will see the toggle of "Unlock with Apple Watch." Tap on that toggle to enable this feature.

After enabling this feature, you can unlock your Apple iPhone SE (2022) with a mask on through your Apple Watch. You need to grab your phone and hold it the same way you would in a normal Face ID scan. The phone will be unlocked, and you will feel a slight vibration on the wrist. Also, a notification will pop up on your watch, indicating that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) has been unlocked.
