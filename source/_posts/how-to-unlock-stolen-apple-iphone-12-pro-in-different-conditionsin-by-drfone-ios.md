After looking at the maybe-trick way of the TikTok viral method and other unlock ways, an official solution from Apple, we also let you know how to fix the disabled iPhone. This method puts your phone into recovery mode with the help of iTunes or Finder on the computer. However, a small lousy side of this method is that it will erase your data along with the passcode.

Before you start, please ensure you have a computer (Mac or PC). If you're using a PC, ensure it has Windows 8 or later and that iTunes is installed. Then, just follow the steps below to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro without a password with iTunes.

- **Step 1:** Turn off your Apple iPhone 12 Pro through the following methods according to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro model.

If the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits the recovery mode screen, let the download finish, turn off your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, and start again.

**_Notice:_** _Before the Finder or iTunes restores your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, it will back up the Apple iPhone 12 Pro data in iCloud. Thus, you can download the restored files after the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device restarts._

## Part 8: Try DFU Mode to Bypass iPhone Passcode

- **Step 2.** Switch off your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and press and hold the Home and the Side/Power button for 10 seconds.
- **Step 3.** Release the Side/Power button, but continue to hold the Home button until iTunes recognizes your Apple iPhone 12 Pro in recovery mode.
- **Step 4.** When your iDevice is in recovery mode, you can use iTunes to restore your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and bypass the passcode.

Remember that using DFU mode to bypass your Apple iPhone 12 Pro passcode will erase all data from your device.
