The competition in the market between Android and iOS has been increased ever since the features are increasing. People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.

Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.

Looking more into the Apple iPhone 13 Pro world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 13 Pro . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.

## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.

### Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal

The **iPhone blacklist removal** method is relatively easy. Here's how you can do it:

**Option 1: Contact the Original Owner**

One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 13 Pro is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 13 Pro ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.

**Option 2: Contact Your Carrier**

Your next option is to contact your carrier for an **iPhone blacklist removal service**.

Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.

If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free.
