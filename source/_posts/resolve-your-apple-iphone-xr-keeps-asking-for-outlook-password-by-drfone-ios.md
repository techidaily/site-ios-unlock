### 2\. Can I Factory Reset my iPhone without Losing the Data?

No. If you want a factory reset, all your data will be erased, so make a backup before proceeding.

But if you want your Apple iPhone XR set to return to the default without losing your data, you can do a "Reset All Settings." This will not touch your data but will return all the default settings.
