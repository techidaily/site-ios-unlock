## **Part 3. Unlock Disabled iPhone 12 by Erasing iPhone in iCloud**

IOS world is different from the Android world, and so, both have different and unique problems to deal with. For example, an android user can never imagine unlocking a disabled phone, but iPhone users surely know how to do it. It might be possible that someone doesn't know how they can erase the Apple iPhone XS Max from iCloud, so for such users, let's provide a step-by-step guideline;

1. Firstly, the user is requested to visit icloud.com on your computer or any other device that is in use. Then log in by using the Apple ID and password.

3. Once you are logged in, choose ‘Find iPhone’ and enter your Apple ID and password again.
4. 4\. Then, you are requested to click on ‘All Devices’ that will appear on the top of the browser and select your device's name from the list provided.

### 2\. Using iTunes

iPhone users can unlock the phone by using iTunes. Following are its pros and cons;

**Cons:**

### 3\. Using iCloud

Another known platform for iPhone users is iCloud, which allows users to unlock the screen without using the passcode. Let us share its pros and cons;

**Pros:**

1. The biggest benefit of using iCloud is that the user doesn't have to connect the Apple iPhone XS Max with the system. Just login is required for iCloud.
2. Another factor is that no technical skills are needed to use iCloud. The user needs access to their iCloud account.

**Cons:**

1. User requires a strong and stable internet connection to log in to iCloud and in case internet is not available, they cannot unlock the screen.
