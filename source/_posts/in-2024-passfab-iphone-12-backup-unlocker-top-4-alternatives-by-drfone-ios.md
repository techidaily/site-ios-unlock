Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account. Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, access the iCloud account from another device. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.

![icloud all devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-12.jpg)
