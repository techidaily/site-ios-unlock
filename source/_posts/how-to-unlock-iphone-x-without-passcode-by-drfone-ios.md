## **Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone X  Activation Lock?**

Protecting user's information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it's lost or stolen.

The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device's misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.

Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone X device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone X device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.

For this, if the Apple iPhone X device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone X  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.
