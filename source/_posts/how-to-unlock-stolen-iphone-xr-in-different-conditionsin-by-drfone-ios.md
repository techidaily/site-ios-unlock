_How do I unlock my Apple iPhone XR? I know you're supposed to connect it to the computer and put it in recovery mode but when I do, it says “unlock Apple iPhone XR to use accessories.”_

## Part 7: Hot FAQ about USB Accessories on iPhone

### Q1: What is the feature of USB Accessories on iPhone?

From USB-A to the latest, USB-C. Also, most iPhones use a proprietary Lightning port.

### Q2: Why does My iPhone Think My Charger is a USB Accessory?
