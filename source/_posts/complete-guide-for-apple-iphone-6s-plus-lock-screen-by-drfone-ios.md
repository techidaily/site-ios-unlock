**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 6s Plus models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 6s Plus 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 6s Plus is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 6s Plus for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and unlocking it.
