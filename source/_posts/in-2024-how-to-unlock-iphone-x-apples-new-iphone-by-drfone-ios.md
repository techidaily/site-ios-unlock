## How to Unlock Apple iPhone X, Apple's New iPhone

It has happened to all of us at some point in the other. The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone X. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone X with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone X is locked now. What to do? Read on.

## Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone X Locked?

There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone X is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone X from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn't for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone X, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone X and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.

We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone X does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone X passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

Step 7: Select the firmware package after the download completes. After the download completes, you can click Unlock Now to start unlocking the Apple iPhone X.

In a short while, your Apple iPhone X will be unlocked. It is important to note that unlocking a locked Apple iPhone X cannot be done without wiping data.

### II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone X with Find My (iPhone)

Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone X remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone X, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone X device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:

Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone X, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit [https://icloud.com](https://icloud.com/) and log into the same iCloud account/ Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone X.

Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone X and click Erase iPhone and confirm.

That's it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone X and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone X was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.

### II.III Put The Apple iPhone X in Recovery Mode

You can unlock your Apple iPhone X using Recovery Mode, yourself.

Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone X to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.

Human life completely changed since the advent of technology. Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours.
