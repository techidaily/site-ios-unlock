On iPhone, employ various methods like navigating settings or using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) for forgotten passcodes. On YouTube, easily toggle Restricted Mode in-app or on the browser for a more controlled viewing experience.

Remember, Dr.Fone becomes a valuable ally when facing a passcode challenge. These versatile solutions grant you control over content accessibility and privacy, enhancing your digital experience. You can easily navigate and customize your device's restrictions by mastering these techniques.
