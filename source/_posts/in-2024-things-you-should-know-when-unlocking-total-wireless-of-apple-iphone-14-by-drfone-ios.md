## Bonus Tip: Prevent iPhone From Getting Locked In Future

It might be in the best interest of your data and device to use a passcode and benefit from biometric security convenience; you must be wondering what you can do to make sure that you avoid forgetting the passcode again. There are a few things you can do:

Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.

So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.

You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.

## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 14

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 14, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 14:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 14 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 14 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 14 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

## Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 14/Apple iPhone 14 mini/Apple iPhone 14 Pro

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 14 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 14 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 14 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 14 range builds on the Apple iPhone 14 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 14 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 14 lineup. the Apple iPhone 14 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 14 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 14 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 14 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 14 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 14 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 14 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

A locked Apple iPhone 14 is never a pretty sight. Fortunately, there are a couple of things you can do to try and unlock your Apple iPhone 14 and remove the passcode from your Apple iPhone 14. There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 14 and unlocking it.
