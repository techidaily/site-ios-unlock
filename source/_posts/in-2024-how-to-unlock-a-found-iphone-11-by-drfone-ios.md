## Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 11

If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 11, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you're coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 11:

Step 1: Launch Settings.

Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.

Step 3: Enter your passcode.

Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.

Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.

You're done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 11 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 11 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 11 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.

The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 11 now. Here is a shortlist of the features of the Apple iPhone 11 range. You may learn more information about Apple iPhone 11 range that you may never know before.

**5G Capability and Dual eSIM Support**

The Apple iPhone 11 range builds on the Apple iPhone 11 12 range for 5G capability by supporting more bands than the Apple iPhone 11 12 lineup. 5G modems are the same across the Apple iPhone 11 lineup. the Apple iPhone 11 lineup supports dual eSIM for the first time ever in iPhones. You do get a physical SIM tray for one nano-SIM though, so don't sit up.

**Cinematic Mode**

You might be wondering if you will get the highlight Cinematic Mode if you were to pick the cheapest of the Apple iPhone 11 lineup, that is, the Apple iPhone 11 mini. The answer is yes, you will. All Apple iPhone 11 models support Cinematic Mode.

**Water Resistance and Charging**

All Apple iPhone 11 models feature the same IP68 water resistance (that is a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes) and feature MagSafe charging. No differences here, except that the Apple iPhone 11 mini is still capped at 12W charging with MagSafe, just like the Apple iPhone 11 12 mini was.

## Part V: The Bottom Line

There is also Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 for you when you need help removing the passcode from your Apple iPhone 11 and unlocking it.
