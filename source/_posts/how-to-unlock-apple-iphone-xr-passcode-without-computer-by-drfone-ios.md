## Part 1. How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?

iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple's security doesn't allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone XR is restricted and doesn't support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone XR is locked or not:

### Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings

To check whether your Apple iPhone XR is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.

- **Step 1.** Firstly, open your Apple iPhone XR "Settings" and tap the "General" option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.

However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.

### 3.2 Apple iCloud Feature

iCloud is a multifunctional drive compatible with iOS and macOS. It saves your data, your media and organizes your files in folders. Moreover, it allows the user to share media, data, files, and even location with the other iPhone/iOS user. The major feature of Apple iCloud is its ‘Backup’ which stores all your data in case you lose or damage your phone.

To fix the Apple iPhone XR passcode, which is not working, iCloud can come in handy. But this method can only work if you've logged in to your iCloud account on your Apple iPhone XR and your "Find My iPhone" application is turned on. All you have to do is erase your data which will automatically erase your passcode through iCloud.

**Step 1: Sign in with Apple ID**

First, open iCloud.com on another iOS and write your credentials to sign in your Apple ID.

**Step 2: Select your Device**

Click on "Find My iPhone" and select "All devices," and a list of devices will come up which are working under the same Apple ID. Select your Apple iPhone XR.
