### 2\. Use Find My

Apple permits clients to erase iPhone data to protect it from others remotely. Nonetheless, your lock screen can save your data if you don't erase the Apple iPhone 6 device. Nobody can open the screen except if they enter the right passcode. After too many incorrect attempts, your Apple iPhone 6 will be locked. So nobody can then touch your data.

If you have enabled the "Find My" choice before failing to remember your Apple iPhone 6 PIN, there is an opportunity for you to eliminate the lock. That is to use iCloud.

**Prerequisites:**
