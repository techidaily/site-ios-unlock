But have you encountered the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed-out</strong> dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 12 or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 12 or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 12 device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 12.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.

Nonetheless, even the most cutting-edge devices experience occasional setbacks. Among these, one major problem for iPhone users is the “iPhone Unavailable” message. This problem typically arises when many incorrect passcode attempts have locked the Apple iPhone 12 device. It renders the Apple iPhone 12 device inaccessible, displaying the “iPhone Unavailable” prompt.</p><p>Yet, worry not, for reliable methods exist to address this problem efficiently. In this guide, we’ll explore the best and proven techniques for <strong>how to fix iPhone unavailable</strong>.

It occurs when their <strong>iPhone becomes unavailable with a black screen</strong> and inaccessible due to many incorrect passcode attempts. This problem arises as a security measure implemented by Apple. Its primary aim is to protect the data on the Apple iPhone 12 device and deter unauthorized access.</p><p>The iPhone’s security mechanism typically activates after six wrong attempts. It starts with making the Apple iPhone 12 unavailable for a specific period. The device becomes permanently locked when the incorrect code is entered consecutively for the 10th time. This lock manifests as the “iPhone Unavailable” message on the screen.</p><p>This acts as a shield against potential intruders trying to gain access by guessing or brute-forcing the passcode. However, this protective measure can affect users who forget their passcodes or insert incorrect entries mistakenly. For example, there are cases of children playing with the Apple iPhone 12 device, leading to accidental key presses. All of this makes learning <strong>how to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 unavailable</strong> an essential thing to learn.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-Fix-Unlock-iPhone-Unavailable-Without-Lossing-Data-By-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-Top-Fix-Unlock-iPhone-Unavailable-Without-Lossing-Data-By-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

In addition, it is the easiest method and requires no prior knowledge. So if you are someone new to this technology, we suggest you follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Launch the Software on your PC</strong></p><p>After successfully installing Dr.Fone on your PC, open it and select the “Screen Unlock” tool from the main interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="select screen unlock"                ></p><p>Next, connect your locked phone to the system through a wired connection.

Recovery or DFU Mode Boot</strong></p><p>It is necessary to first boot your locked device in recovery or DFU mode. Follow the guidelines on your screen to do so. The Recovery mode is the suggested way for iOS screen locks. If you can’t actuate this mode, go for the DFU mode boot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="enter recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads.

Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 8.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 8 and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it.

We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you’re coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 8:</p><p>Step 1: Launch Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 3: Enter your passcode.</p><p>Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="turn passcode off"                ></p><p>Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.</p><p>You’re done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again.

It’s where you find all sorts of useful and fun apps. However, one thing that can be a hassle is the store’s strict verification process. Every time you make a purchase, you need to go through this step.</p><p>It’s there for a good reason – to stop fraud – but it can get annoying, especially if you forget your Apple ID or have other issues. This article will explore the ways to stop the <strong>Apple Store “Verification Required”</strong> prompt, making your app downloading experience smoother.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-01.jpg"                      alt="verification required page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Apple-Require-Verification-in-the-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?"></a>Part 1: Why Does Apple Require Verification in the Apple Store?</h2><p>When browsing the App Store on your Apple iPhone 12 or iPad and looking to download the latest game or productivity tool, you might have noticed that Apple often asks for some form of verification before you can proceed with your purchase. This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.</p><p>The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.</p><p>What does this verification usually involve? It could be entering your Apple ID password or using Face ID or <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-11/iphone-11-touch-id-not-working.html"><u>Touch ID</u></a> if your device supports these features. These methods are designed to confirm your identity quickly and securely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-02.jpg"                      alt="verification required notification"                ></p><h3 id="Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear"><a href="#Reasons-Why-the-Verification-Required-Message-Might-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear"></a>Reasons Why the Verification Required Message Might Appear</h3><p>There are several reasons why you might see an <strong>Apple Store’ Verification</strong> <strong>Required</strong>’ message when trying to download an app or make a purchase:</p><ul><li><strong>New Apple ID</strong>. If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.</li><li><strong>Unpaid balance</strong>. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.</li></ul><p>Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message. It’s not just a random or annoying hurdle; it’s there for your security and to ensure a smooth, safe experience when using the App Store.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Verification-Required-Prompt-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Verification Required Prompt Using Apple ID</h2><p>Having to deal with the ‘Verification Required’ prompt in the App Store can be a bit of a hassle, especially when you’re eager to get your hands on a new app or game. Fortunately, there are several methods you can use to resolve this issue, most of which are pretty straightforward and can be done right from your device. Here’s how to tackle it:</p><h3 id="Update-Payment-Method"><a href="#Update-Payment-Method" class="headerlink" title="Update Payment Method"></a>Update Payment Method</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for the verification prompt is a problem with your payment method. To fix this, go to your Apple ID settings on your Apple iPhone 12 or iPad. Tap your name at the top of the <strong>Settings app</strong>, then go to <strong>Payment &amp; Shipping</strong>. You can update your payment information or add a new payment method here. Make sure the details are correct and up to date.</p><h3 id="Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions"><a href="#Check-Unpaid-Subscriptions" class="headerlink" title="Check Unpaid Subscriptions"></a>Check Unpaid Subscriptions</h3><p>Sometimes, unpaid subscriptions can trigger the verification prompt. Tap the App Store &gt; your profile icon, and select <strong>Subscriptions</strong>. Here, you can view all your subscriptions, active or expired. Check if there are any unpaid ones and clear any outstanding payments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-03.jpg"                      alt="subscriptions page app store"                ></p><h3 id="Don’t-Require-Password-for-Purchases"><a href="#Don’t-Require-Password-for-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Require Password for Purchases"></a>Don’t Require Password for Purchases</h3><p>For less frequent purchases, you should change the settings so you don’t always have to enter your password. Go to Settings, then to <strong>Screen Time</strong>. Under <strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</strong>, select <strong>iTunes &amp; App Store Purchases</strong>. Here, you can change the settings to <strong>Don’t Require</strong> for purchases. However, be cautious with this method as it reduces security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/bypass-appstore-verification-04.jpg"                      alt="screen time app store purchases"                ></p><h3 id="Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-and-Re-Sign-In"><a href="#Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-and-Re-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In"></a>Sign Out of Apple ID and Re-Sign In</h3><p>Sometimes, simply <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html"><u>signing out of your Apple ID</u></a> and then signing back in can resolve the issue.

Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus without a passcode.</p><p>There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone’s stock features like Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus lock screen.</p><p>So, let’s get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Plus lock screen.</p><h2 id="4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-without-Passcode"><a href="#4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus without Passcode"></a>4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus without Passcode</h2><p>Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Plus without a passcode:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes"><a href="#Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes"></a>Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="using itunes to unlock iphone"                ></p><p>Follow the steps to do this.</p><ol><li>First, connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to your computer and launch iTunes.

So, select your device from the list.</li><li>Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named <strong>Restore iPhone</strong>.</li><li>By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus XR lock screen without any passcode.</li></ol><h3 id="Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone"></a>Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone</h3><p>If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven’t used iTunes before, we have another solution.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

Get Answers here"></a>What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 15 Plus i Do? Get Answers here</h2><p>Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>. Let’s start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone devices back view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?"></a>Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?</h2><p>Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, it’s crucial to understand, “<strong>What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone</strong>?” While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 15 Plus based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 15 Plus from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>, leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password"></a>Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password</h2><p>Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.

However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don’t erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 15 Plus will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.</p><p>If you have enabled the “Find My” option before <strong>forgotten iPhone PIN</strong>, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.</p><p>To unlock iPhone through iCloud:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the “Find iPhone” option from the different choices available.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Click “All Devices” and pick the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you need to unlock.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “Erase iPhone” button.

Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.</p><p>Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.</p><p>Additionally, ensure that you keep your iDevices’ Apple ID details safe. Else, you will not have the option to use the iDevice again. Using iTunes will erase the screen’s password but not the firmware.

Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device shows the recovery mode screen.</p><p><strong>On iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Or Below:</strong> Press and hold the power button until you see the power off slider. Next, move the slider to turn off the iPhone. Then, press the Volume (-) button and connect the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</strong></p><p>After you connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the “Your iPhone name” and ask you to restore it. In that window, select “Restore” to erase the iPhone. If iTunes doesn’t run naturally, open iTunes by double tapping it.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up iPhone.</strong></p><p>Keep waiting until the restoration completes. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and follow the on-screen directions. That will allow you to set up and utilize your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-4.jpg"                      alt="itunes unlock"                ></p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4.

Just sign out of all Apple services and devices that use your account first.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/"><u>Apple ID</u></a> official website and log in to your account credentials.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-03.jpg"                      alt="apple id website interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once logged in, select <strong>Apple ID</strong> in the <strong>Sign-In and Security</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-04.jpg"                      alt="apple id sign in and security"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the <strong>Apple ID</strong> pop-up window, enter your new Apple ID in the <strong>Change your Apple ID</strong> text field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-05.jpg"                      alt="enter a new apple id interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select <strong>Change Apple ID</strong> to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check your email to get a verification code sent by Apple to ensure that only you can change it to a third-party email address.

It’s possible, but it depends on your location, how you created your account, and what version of iOS you’re using.</p><p>If you’re in China mainland or India, and you’re using iOS 11 or later, you can create a new Apple ID with Your Apple iPhone XR number as the username. However, Your Apple iPhone XR number must be (+86) or (+91). So, if you’re thinking of, “<strong>How can I change my Apple ID on my iPad</strong> if it’s a mobile phone number?” then this guide is for you:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log out of all Apple services and devices currently signed in with your Apple ID, except the one you’re using to change your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On your iPad, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>[your account name]</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign-in &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Edit</strong> next to <strong>Email &amp; Phone Numbers</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-06.jpg"                      alt="click edit on iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to the <strong>Delete</strong> icon next to your mobile number and follow the directions given.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter the code sent to the mobile number you added as your new Apple ID to verify it.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Log into all Apple services using your new Apple ID.</li></ul><p>Even if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to a mobile phone number, you can still associate it with a phone number on your account page. It means you can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/apple-account/how-to-remove-phone-number-from-apple-id.html"><u>use a different email address or mobile phone number to log in to your Apple ID</u></a>. See the next sections for more information on the workarounds you can try.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-To-Do-if-You-Cannot-Change-Your-Apple-ID-on-iPad"><a href="#Part-3-What-To-Do-if-You-Cannot-Change-Your-Apple-ID-on-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What To Do if You Cannot Change Your Apple ID on iPad?"></a>Part 3: What To Do if You Cannot Change Your Apple ID on iPad?</h2><p><strong>Changing your Apple ID on an iPad</strong> is usually easy. However, there can be setbacks during the process. Now, here’s what to do if you find yourself unable to do it and why it might be happening:</p><p>Try Again Later</p><p>If you encounter errors during the process, give it a little time and try again. Mayne it is because you <strong>changed your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to an iCloud email address within 30 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-07.jpg"                      alt="change apple id to icloud email"                ></p><p>Check if Apple ID Is Already in Use</p><p>Apple IDs are unique, and you can’t have two identical ones. If you’re trying to change your Apple ID to one that’s already in use, you’ll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn’t already taken. Remove it from the family member’s account if they are using it.</p><p>Your Apple ID Is an Email Address</p><p>If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won’t be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.</p><p>If you’ve addressed these issues and still can’t change your Apple ID, don’t worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges. Contact them for guidance and solutions tailored to your situation.</p><p>However, if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> because you forgot or don’t have access to the password, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone. This tool is easy to use and can help you unlock your iPad and remove the Apple ID in a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Using Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Part 4: Using <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></h2><p>Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) tool is your go-to solution for unlocking iOS devices without a passcode. The best part? It is easy to use for users of all technical backgrounds. With Dr.Fone, you can unlock iOS screens protected by 4 to 6-digit passcodes, Face ID, Touch ID, and more.</p><p>But it doesn’t stop there; Dr.Fone can also help <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html"><u>remove the iCloud activation lock</u></a>, unlock Apple ID without a password, and much more. This powerful tool is a lifesaver for iOS users, supporting the latest iPadOS 17, iOS 17, and iPhone 14.</p><p>Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Apple ID on iPad Using Dr.Fone</p><p>Dr.Fone can bypass the Find My&#x2F;Find My iPhone feature to remove your Apple ID from your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch.

You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.</p><p>Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you’re getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Password Check</strong></li></ul><p>Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid Sharing an Apple ID</strong></li></ul><p>It’s best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></li></ul><p>If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It’s simple and highly effective.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137378/7443" target="_top" id="2137378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Changing your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other iOS devices is a simple process that can help you protect your privacy and information.

It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the “iPhone Locked to Owner” scenario can be hard as the fault doesn’t lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037345/7443" target="_top" id="2037345">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037345" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037345/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068412/7443" target="_top" id="2068412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device will remain locked to the previous owner’s iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner-Security"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner-Security" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner Security"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner Security</h2><p>Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner’s security can be frustrating. That’s why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to <strong><strong>bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max locked to the owner for free</strong></strong>. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device"><a href="#Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device"></a>Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device</h3><p>If you’ve recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.</p><p>To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step:</strong></strong> Access your locked iPhone and tap “Unlock with Passcode.” On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg"                      alt="tap unlock with passcode"                ></p></li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device-Using-iCloud"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device-Using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device Using iCloud"></a>Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device Using iCloud</h3><p>The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn’t remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.</p><p>To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Access the iCloud website on your computer’s browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the “Find My” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg"                      alt="select find my feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from “All Devices.” Now choose “Erase iPhone” from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and remove the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on erase iphone"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner"></a>Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner</h3><p>When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.</p><p>The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. This loophole has now been patched by Apple. Given below is the detailed process to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Activation Lock:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Power on your iDevice or restart it if your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is already powered on. Access your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Settings to tap “Wi-Fi” and navigate to the “Choose Wi-Fi Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> Select “More Wi-Fi Settings” using the “i” symbol next to the displayed Wi-Fi network. Here, choose “Configure DNS” and follow it by selecting the “Manual” option.</p></li><li><p><strong><strong>Step 3:</strong></strong> Afterward, press “Add Server,” located under “DNS Servers.” Now enter the appropriate DNS server address based on your location:</p></li><li><p>For users in the United States&#x2F;North America: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>For users in Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>For users in Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>For users in the rest of the world: 78.109.17.60</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-5.jpg"                      alt="use the dns method"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 4:</strong></strong> Save the changes by selecting “Save.” Use the back arrow button to go back and choose “Ask to Join Networks.” Enter the network password and tap “Join.” Press the back arrow button when your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max attempts to activate. Afterward, continue to set up your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-4-Take-Help-From-the-Online-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Removal-Service"><a href="#Method-4-Take-Help-From-the-Online-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Removal-Service" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service"></a>Method 4: Take Help From the Online iCloud Activation Lock Removal Service</h3><p>What to do if you have been unable to contact the previous owner and the DNS method isn’t working? The answer is you can also employ an online iCloud Activation removal service. These services charge you some money and unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone SE (2020):</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone SE (2020) based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone SE (2020) from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone SE (2020):</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS.
