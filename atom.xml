The quality of the products is unquestionable – few can argue the superior quality of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s camera, for instance. Almost all devices are long-lasting. They have a great resale value. They offer cutting-edge features.</p><p>However, perhaps the greatest advantage of Apple products is just how well they integrate with one another and work together.</p><p>With a quick little tap, you can have your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s camera working as your Mac’s webcam. You can use your iPad as a second Mac display. Take calls using any device.</p><p>Moreover, you might be able to <strong>use the Apple Watch to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>.</p><p>Now, you cannot just <strong>unlock any Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with your Watch</strong>. The devices must be paired, and you’ll need to follow a few steps to enable this option. Here’s how to unlock your phone using your Apple Watch like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Use-an-Apple-Watch-To-Unlock-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Use-an-Apple-Watch-To-Unlock-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

While you’ll need a passcode just as another security layer, you won’t have to worry about someone else breaking in if they know it, going through your messages, or collecting your private information.</p><p>With face ID, only you can unlock your phone, sign in to your favorite apps, and even authenticate purchases.</p><p>The problem is that neither face ID nor traditional passcodes aren’t always the most convenient option. If you wear sunglasses, safety goggles, a face mask, or other face coverings and can’t take them off for some reason, face ID won’t work. If you have gloves on and can’t type in your passcode, your passcodes won’t work.</p><p>What could work is your Apple Watch.</p><p>Depending on the Apple Watch version you own and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model, you could use your watch to unlock your phone in any circumstances. It’s easy, secure, and convenient, above all else.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Requirements-for-Unlocking-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-With-Apple-Watch"><a href="#Part-2-Requirements-for-Unlocking-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-With-Apple-Watch" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password.

This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1.

Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2.

Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4.

Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won’t take a lot of time at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png"                      alt="checking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup never set in the first place!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png"                      alt="removed"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work.

Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously.

Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</li></ul><p>While this method doesn’t give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device’s features.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned methods works for you, or you don’t want to use them, there is another method that will surely work for you.

Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</p><ol><li>Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.</li><li>Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13.

As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-X-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-X-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from being unlocked by thieves"></a>Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from being unlocked by thieves</h2><p>It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

When you seek the answer to <strong>how to unlock a lost iPhone</strong> with Siri, you need to be aware of a very specific pointer. It is necessary to note that this method only works for devices operating between iOS 8 and 11.</p><p>This later turned out to be an anomaly in Siri that led users to unlock their iOS devices. If you have a device running within this iOS version range, learn how to unlock it with the provided steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Start by activating the Siri on your iOS device. Ask a simple question about time, like “What time is it?” Once Siri is active, a clock will display on your device screen. Next, access the clock and find the “World Clock” screen on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Tap the “+” button at the screen’s top right corner. Enter the name of any city in the “Search Bar,” tap Select All, and choose “Share.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="access world clocks via siri"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the sharing options, look for “Messages.” As you access the next screen, type anything in the “To” section and continue to select it by navigating to the “Create a New Contact” option. When providing the contact details, tap the “Add Photo” button. Lead into the Photos app from there and swipe up the screen or press the “Home” button to access the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-to-unlock-stolen-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="access photos app to unlock"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-All-Data-Lost-Trying-Recovery-Mode-for-Unlocking-Stolen-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-All-Data-Lost-Trying-Recovery-Mode-for-Unlocking-Stolen-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Get Answers here</h2><p>Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>, leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password"></a>Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password</h2><p>Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It’s user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.</p><p>Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:</p><ul><li>Can remove all types of locked screen</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html"><u>Remove SIM lock</u></a>&#x2F; unlock iPhone carrier without losing data</li><li>Unlock Apple ID without a password</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>Bypass MDM without data loss</u></a></li><li>Remove iTunes backup encryption</li></ul><p>Dr.Fone uses the responsible path of jailbreaking your iOS device, giving you back control.

Don’t worry! There are plenty of ways to app lock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and protect your privacy. You can follow the same drill to restrict the usage of certain apps for your kids as well by taking the assistance of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max app lock feature. The app lock for iPhone and iPad options can be used pretty easily. There are plenty of native and third-party solutions out there that you can use. In this post, we will make you familiar with seven different techniques on how to lock apps on iPhones and iPads.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Screen-Time"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Screen-Time" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Screen Time?"></a>Part 1: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Screen Time?</h2><p>Utilizing Screen Time on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a versatile way to manage app access. It is done through time restrictions and a dedicated passcode. By implementing Screen Time settings, you can exercise control over app usage. It ensures added security and regulated access to your preferred applications. Now, let’s walk through the steps to learn <strong>how to lock apps on iPhone</strong> Screen Time:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by accessing the Settings on your iOS device and tapping on the “Screen Time” option. On the ensuing screen, tap “App Limits,” followed by “Add Limit.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the app limits option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the apps or categories of the apps, tap “Next,” and choose the “Time Limit” for the selected apps. After deciding the time limit, press “Add” from the top right corner to add an app limitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on add limit option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-with-Face-ID-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?"></a>Part 2: How to Lock Apps on iPhone with Face ID &amp; Passcode?</h2><p>Leveraging the advanced security capabilities of Face ID or Passcode on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max X or later models effectively fortifies app access. By using facial recognition or passcodes, you can put in place an extra layer of protection. It can be done for specific apps, safeguarding your sensitive data from unauthorized access. Now, let’s proceed with the detailed steps to lock apps using Face ID or Passcode on your iOS device:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> After opening the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, scroll down to access “Face ID &amp; Passcode.” Here, you will be required to provide the passcode of your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After providing the passcode, select “Other Apps” and check the apps that have Face ID enabled. Remember, you’re unable to manually include apps in the list. Only those apps that have sought access to the feature will appear here automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="access face id and passcode option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?"></a>Part 3: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Shortcuts?</h2><p>If you are unable to lock the targeted app directly with Face ID, there is no need to worry. There exist workarounds that you can use, and one of them is using the Shortcuts app. It won’t directly lock apps with the Face ID. Instead, it provides a workaround by creating a shortcut that redirects to the lock screen.</p><p>When activated, it takes you to the lock screen, prompting Face ID, Touch ID, or Passcode to access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device again. Use the following steps to lock your apps using the Shortcuts app:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, launch the Shortcuts app and select the “Automation” tab from the bottom toolbar. There, tap “New Automation” and use the search bar to look for and select “App.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="choose app automation option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, tap “Choose” in front of the “App” and select the app you want to lock. Now, move down and select “Is Opened,” then move further down to choose “Run Immediately.” Here, leave “Notify when Run” deactivated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="customize app automation settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Proceed forward by tapping “Next” from the top right corner, and on the following screen, tap “New Blank Automation.” Then, press “Add Action” and enter “Lock Screen” into the Search field, then choose “Lock Screen” from the search results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="search for lock screen option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Finally, tap “Done” to finalize the shortcut. Now, upon accessing the targeted app, the shortcut will activate in the background, causing your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to be locked. You can then use the Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to unlock it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="press the done option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Lock-Apps-on-iPhone-Using-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?"></a>Part 4: How to Lock Apps on iPhone Using Restrictions?</h2><p>By taking the assistance of Apple’s native Restrictions feature, you can app lock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without any trouble. In this way, you can set up a passcode that needs to be matched before accessing any app. This iPhone app lock is also a great way to restrict your kids from accessing certain apps or making purchases. To learn how to lock apps on iPhone or iPad using Restrictions, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your device and go to its Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060134646367.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone restrictions"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Turn the feature on and set up a passcode for app restrictions. To provide added security, you can set up a passcode that is not similar to your lock screen passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can set up an app lock for iPhone using Restrictions. Simply go to General &gt; Restrictions and turn this feature on for any app of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060135059851.jpg"                      alt="turn on restrictions for the app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If you want, then you can also switch this feature off for any app using the same method.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-withoutScreen-Locks-PIN-pattern-fingerprints-face"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-withoutScreen-Locks-PIN-pattern-fingerprints-face" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: How to Unlock iPhone withoutScreen Locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face)"></a>Bonus Tip: How to Unlock iPhone withoutScreen Locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face)</h3><p>It can be a trouble if you forget your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode since there are many restrictions on using iPhone.

But have you encountered the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed-out</strong> dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.

Lock Apps onApple iPhone 15 Pro Max &amp; iPad via Famisafe</h3><p>If the reason you want to lock the apps on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has to do with managing your kid’s phone usage, we have an excellent alternative for you. <a class="link"   href="https://famisafe.wondershare.com/" >FamiSafe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a reliable parental control app that offers features to monitor and manage a child’s device usage. It focuses on parental controls, including features like screen time management, location tracking, web filtering, and activity monitoring.</p><p>It offers robust controls to restrict overall device usage, set screen time limits, and monitor app usage. This helps parents guide and regulate their children’s activities on iOS devices. You can use the following steps to lock apps using FamiSafe:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install FamiSafe and FamiSafe Jr on Respective Devices</strong></p><p>Get FamiSafe from the App Store and log in using your Wondershare ID or your Apple, Google, or Facebook account. Select the parent mode and link your child’s phone by installing FamiSafe Jr on their devices using either the QR code or the pairing code. Once the pairing is done, input details about your children and allow FamiSafe Jr to oversee their devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="download the famisafe apps"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Provide the Necessary Permissions to FamiSafe</strong></p><p>Now, activate Accessibility for FamiSafe by accessing “Settings,” tapping “FamiSafe,” and enabling “Location.” Then, grant access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s photos, microphone, and motion &amp; fitness activity. Now, use a computer and connect your child’s device with a USB cable. Activate content blockers in Safari to prevent kids from accessing inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-10.jpg"                      alt="enable the content blockers"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Connect the Kid’s Device to the Computer</strong></p><p>To do that, access “Safari” in “Settings” and move to”Content Blockers” to enable FamiSafe. To get started, connect your kids’ iOS devices to your PC. Once connected, navigate to the main interface and select “Features” located at the bottom. This will display available features, and you can proceed by tapping on “App Blocker.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-11.jpg"                      alt="select the app blocker feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Block Any App Using the App Blocker Feature</strong></p><p>Establish the connection between your kids’ iOS devices and your PC by pairing them with your phone. From there, effortlessly choose and block any unwanted apps on your kids’ phones. Additionally, you have the option to block apps based on their App Store ratings for added control and security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/lock-apps-on-iphone-12.jpg"                      alt="block the required apps"                ></p><h3 id="2-Lock-apps-onApple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iPad-using-App-Locker"><a href="#2-Lock-apps-onApple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iPad-using-App-Locker" class="headerlink" title="2. Lock apps onApple iPhone 15 Pro Max &amp; iPad using App Locker"></a>2. Lock apps onApple iPhone 15 Pro Max &amp; iPad using App Locker</h3><p>Besides the native iPhone app lock solutions, you can also take the assistance of a third-party tool. However, most of these apps only support jailbroken devices. Therefore, if you wish to use a dedicated app lock for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, then you need to jailbreak your device. Needless to say, getting your device jailbroken has its perks and demerits. If you don’t want to jailbreak your device, then you can simply take the assistance of the above-mentioned solutions.</p><p>However, if you have a jailbroken device and would like to app lock the iPhone, then you can also use AppLocker. It is available at Cydia’s repository and can be purchased for just $0.99. It can be installed on your jailbroken device to get an added level of security. Not just apps, it can also be used to lock certain settings, folders, accessibilities, and more. To learn how to lock apps on iPhone using AppLocker, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, get AppLocker on your device from <a class="link"   href="http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker" >http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. As of now, it works on iOS 6 to 10 versions.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After installing the tweak, you can go to Settings &gt; Applocker to access it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136509845.jpg"                      alt="iphone applocker"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> To access the feature, make sure that you have “<strong>Enabled</strong>” it (by turning it on).</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This will let you set up a passcode to lock the apps and settings of your choice.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> To app lock, the iPhone, visit the “<strong>Application Locking</strong>” feature on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136826933.jpg"                      alt="application locking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> From here, you can turn on (or off) the locking feature for apps of your choice.</p><p>This will let your app lock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without any trouble. You can also go to the “Reset Password Phrase” to change the passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Lock-Apps-onApple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iPad-using-BioProtect"><a href="#3-Lock-Apps-onApple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iPad-using-BioProtect" class="headerlink" title="3. Lock Apps onApple iPhone 15 Pro Max &amp; iPad using BioProtect"></a>3. Lock Apps onApple iPhone 15 Pro Max &amp; iPad using BioProtect</h3><p>Just like Applocker, BioProtect is another third-party tool that works only on jailbroken devices. It can also be downloaded from Cydia’s repository. Apart from apps, you can also use BioProtect to lock settings, SIM features, folders, and more. It is linked to the Touch ID of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and scans the fingerprint of a user to grant (or deny) access to any app. The app only works on iPhone 5s and later devices, having a Touch ID. However, you can also set a passcode as well if your Touch ID is not working. To use the BioProtect app lock for iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, get the BioProtect app to lock iPhone on your device from the right <a class="link"   href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/net.limneos.bioprotect/" >http://cydia.saurik.com/package/net.limneos.bioprotect/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> To access the tweak’s panel, you need to provide your fingerprint access.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Place your finger on your Touch ID and match its print.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137022586.jpg"                      alt="app is locked"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This will let you access the BioProtect app settings.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Firstly, enable the app by turning the respective feature on.</p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Under the “<strong>Protected Applications</strong>” section, you can see a list of all the major apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137256044.jpg"                      alt="protected applications"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Simply turn on (or off) the feature of the app that you wish to lock.</p><p><strong>Step 8.</strong> You can also go to the “Touch ID” feature to further calibrate the app.</p><p><strong>Step 9.</strong> After setting the lock, you would be asked to authenticate using your fingerprint to access the protected app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060137676497.jpg"                      alt="authenticate using fingerprint"                ></p><h3 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h3><p>By following these solutions, you would be able to learn how to lock apps on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without much trouble.

If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>. Unsupported or invalid credit cards can trigger the verification notice, as Apple can’t process payments with these cards.</li><li><strong>Unpaid balance</strong>. If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>. For those using Family Sharing, if the family organizer has placed restrictions on your account, this could result in a verification prompt.</li></ul><p>Understanding these reasons is the first step in addressing the ‘Verification Required’ message.

You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads.

You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults.

People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.</p><p>Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  without Passcode [No iTunes]"></a><strong>Part 2. Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max  without Passcode [No iTunes]</strong></h2><p>The major difference between the lock screen and activation lock is that the lock screen can be bypassed without the password but, the user can never bypass the activation lock as it marks the security boundary of Apple.</p><p>You might be wondering how to escape the lock screen without a password because it is possible that you might forget the password, and now you can’t open your phone. Let’s look at how you can do this;</p><p>The commonly faced problem of many iOS users was that they forget the password but later, an amazing solution to this problem as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> application was known and used by almost all iOS users. Some of its features are;</p><ul><li>The application is easy to use.

This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security.

You can track purchases and manage your account settings through your Apple ID. But what if you need a new one for security or moving to a new location?</p><p>Whatever the reason, learning <strong>how to change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> is straightforward. And this guide will show the steps and provide some tips at the end.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-01.jpg"                      alt="browsing on an ipad pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-Why-You-Might-Need-To-Change-Your-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-Why-You-Might-Need-To-Change-Your-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID"></a>Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID</h2><p>Your iOS devices contain most of your digital data. That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.</p><p>If you feel the existing Apple ID isn’t secure enough, it’s a good idea to <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other devices. Aside from this, there are a few scenarios where you might find yourself needing to change your details:</p><p>You No Longer Use the Email Address or Phone Number Associated With Your Apple ID</p><p>Life moves fast, and sometimes contact info changes. If the email or phone number linked to your Apple ID becomes outdated, it’s a good idea to update it. That way, you won’t miss out on vital notifications or have trouble recovering your account if needed.</p><p>You Want To Simplify Your Online Life</p><p>If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.</p><p>You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country</p><p>Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-02.jpg"                      alt="apple id account information"                ></p><p>Changing your Apple ID can be smart, ensuring your digital life stays up-to-date, secure, and tailored to your needs.

You can update your Apple ID account anytime without disrupting your data. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to change your Apple ID</strong> email address. Just sign out of all Apple services and devices that use your account first.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/"><u>Apple ID</u></a> official website and log in to your account credentials.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-03.jpg"                      alt="apple id website interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once logged in, select <strong>Apple ID</strong> in the <strong>Sign-In and Security</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-04.jpg"                      alt="apple id sign in and security"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the <strong>Apple ID</strong> pop-up window, enter your new Apple ID in the <strong>Change your Apple ID</strong> text field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-05.jpg"                      alt="enter a new apple id interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select <strong>Change Apple ID</strong> to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check your email to get a verification code sent by Apple to ensure that only you can change it to a third-party email address.

It’s possible, but it depends on your location, how you created your account, and what version of iOS you’re using.</p><p>If you’re in China mainland or India, and you’re using iOS 11 or later, you can create a new Apple ID with Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max number as the username. However, Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max number must be (+86) or (+91). So, if you’re thinking of, “<strong>How can I change my Apple ID on my iPad</strong> if it’s a mobile phone number?” then this guide is for you:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log out of all Apple services and devices currently signed in with your Apple ID, except the one you’re using to change your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On your iPad, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>[your account name]</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign-in &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Edit</strong> next to <strong>Email &amp; Phone Numbers</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-06.jpg"                      alt="click edit on iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to the <strong>Delete</strong> icon next to your mobile number and follow the directions given.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter the code sent to the mobile number you added as your new Apple ID to verify it.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Log into all Apple services using your new Apple ID.</li></ul><p>Even if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to a mobile phone number, you can still associate it with a phone number on your account page.

However, there can be setbacks during the process. Now, here’s what to do if you find yourself unable to do it and why it might be happening:</p><p>Try Again Later</p><p>If you encounter errors during the process, give it a little time and try again. Mayne it is because you <strong>changed your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to an iCloud email address within 30 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-07.jpg"                      alt="change apple id to icloud email"                ></p><p>Check if Apple ID Is Already in Use</p><p>Apple IDs are unique, and you can’t have two identical ones. If you’re trying to change your Apple ID to one that’s already in use, you’ll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn’t already taken. Remove it from the family member’s account if they are using it.</p><p>Your Apple ID Is an Email Address</p><p>If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won’t be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.</p><p>If you’ve addressed these issues and still can’t change your Apple ID, don’t worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges. Contact them for guidance and solutions tailored to your situation.</p><p>However, if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> because you forgot or don’t have access to the password, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone. This tool is easy to use and can help you unlock your iPad and remove the Apple ID in a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Using Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Part 4: Using <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></h2><p>Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) tool is your go-to solution for unlocking iOS devices without a passcode.

Whether getting region-specific apps, accessing exclusive content, or switching to a country with better app offerings, it’s a valuable capability.</p><p>The article below guides you through seven methods on <strong>how to change the country of your App Store</strong>.Following the guide ensures access to a world of apps and content tailored to your preferences. Keep reading the page below to achieve this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-app-store-country-01.jpg"                      alt="app store icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-1-Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

From here, you can view the clock interface. Tap on the “+” icon to add another clock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/10/15075516291472.jpg"                      alt="add world clock"                ></p><p>5.

This allows the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to operate with different network providers worldwide. Numerous tools and techniques exist to unlock phones.

For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to a Windows&#x2F; macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn’t require going through complex hoops.</p><p>Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 1: Visit <em><a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> and log in into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my iphone"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max remotely and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max once again.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App"><a href="#Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App"></a>Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Using Find My iPhone App</h2><p>There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. This method is particularly useful if you’re traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="find my on macos"                ></p><p>Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices from the left pane, click&#x2F; tap your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and click&#x2F; tap Erase This Device</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Without-A-Computer"><a href="#Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Without-A-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without A Computer"></a>Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without A Computer</h2><p>There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and return the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-clearscreenstreamer-seamless-easy-w11-screenshots/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  ClearScreenStreamer  Seamless, Easy W11 Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-peering-into-the-pantheon-of-social-media-mavens-in-your-area/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Peering Into the Pantheon of Social Media Mavens in Your Area</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-guide-to-adding-filters-effects-and-masks-in-google-meet/"><u>[New] In 2024, Guide to Adding Filters, Effects, and Masks in Google Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-instagram-transformation-editors-that-impress-for-2024/"><u>[New] Instagram Transformation  Editors That Impress for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-stream-wars-evaluating-streamers-top-contenders-obs-and-wirecast/"><u>[New] Stream Wars  Evaluating Streamers' Top Contenders, OBS & Wirecast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/op-10-best-flvto-alternatives-youtube-converter-you-can-try/"><u>[New] Top 10 Best Flvto Alternatives YouTube Converter You Can Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-cloud-economy-unveiling-best-deals/"><u>[Updated] Cloud Economy  Unveiling Best Deals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-creating-humor-making-funny-parody-videos/"><u>[Updated] Creating Humor  Making Funny Parody Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-dissecting-backwards-image-trails-on-social-media-giant-facebook-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Dissecting Backwards Image Trails on Social Media Giant Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-nailing-your-online-visibility-with-optimal-youtube-thumbnail-dimensions/"><u>[Updated] Nailing Your Online Visibility with Optimal YouTube Thumbnail Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-ultimate-editing-software-listings/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate Editing Software Listings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/beyond-typography-decoding-the-subtext-of-snapchat-emojis-for-2024/"><u>Beyond Typography  Decoding the Subtext of Snapchat Emojis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/boost-your-presence-on-twitter-expert-strategies-to-pre-schedule-posts-and-engage-followers/"><u>Boost Your Presence on Twitter: Expert Strategies to Pre-Schedule Posts and Engage Followers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-recovering-pictures-files-on-infinix-note-30i-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>Complete guide for recovering pictures files on Infinix Note 30i.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/did-your-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-passcode-change-itself-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Did Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Passcode Change Itself?

Here’s the Fix</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?"></a>Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?</h2><p>When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup unlocking never set by you.</p><p>But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let’s talk about them.</p><h2 id="Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.</p><p>One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone"></a>1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won’t take a lot of time at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png"                      alt="checking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup never set in the first place!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png"                      alt="removed"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to “Reset All Settings” on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to avoid the problem of iTunes backup password never set.</p><h2 id="How-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Passcode-without-Computer"><a href="#How-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-Passcode-without-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Passcode without Computer?"></a>How to Unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Passcode without Computer?</h2><p><em>“How to unlock Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode without computer?

It saves your data, your media and organizes your files in folders. Moreover, it allows the user to share media, data, files, and even location with the other iPhone&#x2F;iOS user. The major feature of Apple iCloud is its ‘Backup’ which stores all your data in case you lose or damage your phone.</p><p>To fix the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode, which is not working, iCloud can come in handy. But this method can only work if you’ve logged in to your iCloud account on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and your “Find My iPhone” application is turned on. All you have to do is erase your data which will automatically erase your passcode through iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign in with Apple ID</strong></p><p>First, open iCloud.com on another iOS and write your credentials to sign in your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Select your Device</strong></p><p>Click on “Find My iPhone” and select “All devices,” and a list of devices will come up which are working under the same Apple ID.
