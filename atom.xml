Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone X, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone X without a passcode.</p><p>There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone X without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone’s stock features like Find My Apple iPhone X or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone X lock screen.</p><p>So, let’s get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone X lock screen.</p><h2 id="4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-X-without-Passcode"><a href="#4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-X-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone X without Passcode"></a>4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone X without Passcode</h2><p>Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone X without a passcode:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes"><a href="#Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes"></a>Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone X passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="using itunes to unlock iphone"                ></p><p>Follow the steps to do this.</p><ol><li>First, connect your Apple iPhone X to your computer and launch iTunes. You will have to install it if you don’t have it on your computer. For installation, <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes" >click here and download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.</li><li>Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone X’s specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named <strong>Restore iPhone</strong>.</li><li>By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone X, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone X XR lock screen without any passcode.</li></ol><h3 id="Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone"></a>Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone</h3><p>If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven’t used iTunes before, we have another solution. You can use the “Find My iPhone” feature to erase your device and unlock it. This is useful when you quickly want to unlock your Apple iPhone X without a passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-2.jpg"                      alt="using find my iphone to unlock iphone"                ></p><p>All you have to do is follow the steps given below.</p><ol><li>Log in to <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/" >the iCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website on your MacBook or Computer. For this, you will need to use your Apple ID and Password that you are using on your Apple iPhone X.</li><li>Once you are logged in to iCloud, you will see many options and features but look for the Find My iPhone option.</li><li>Once you find it, click on it, and you will see a few more options, and one of them would be <strong>Erase iPhone</strong>.</li><li>You will have to click on it, showing you a confirmation message to erase all your data on your Apple iPhone X.</li><li>Confirm it, and your Apple iPhone X will be restored to the factory settings, and all your data will be removed.</li><li>Once the process is completed, you can unlock your Apple iPhone X X lock screen without any passcode.</li></ol><h3 id="Method-3-Remove-Passcode-With-Tapping-Erase-Phone-iOS-15-2-only"><a href="#Method-3-Remove-Passcode-With-Tapping-Erase-Phone-iOS-15-2-only" class="headerlink" title="Method #3: Remove Passcode With Tapping Erase Phone (iOS 15.2 only)"></a>Method #3: Remove Passcode With Tapping Erase Phone (iOS 15.2 only)</h3><p>If both above-given methods don’t work for you, or you don’t have access to a computer or MacBook to use those methods, there is a 3rd method for you. But it only works on iPhones with iOS 15.2 versions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-3.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone feature"                ></p><p>With this method, you can follow the steps below to remove the screen lock passcode on Apple iPhone X.</p><ol><li>First, you must try unlocking your Apple iPhone X with all the possible passcodes you remember.</li><li>When you try too many wrong passcode attempts, iPhone will show you a message that states that your Apple iPhone X is locked for 1-15 minutes.</li><li>By this message, you will also see another option at the bottom right corner named <strong>Erase iPhone</strong>.</li><li>By clicking this option, you will be asked about your <strong>Apple ID and Password</strong> that you have used on this iPhone.</li><li>So provide them, and you will be able to erase your Apple iPhone X, and in the end, your Apple iPhone X will be unlocked without needing a passcode or password.</li></ol><h3 id="Method-4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#Method-4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Method #4: Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>Method #4: Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>This is the most effective and easiest way to remove or break your Apple iPhone X passcode.

These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone X screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone X device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone X. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone X lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone.

It’s taking your Apple iPhone SE off the “naughty list” and making it work like it should again. And the best part? You can do it without spending a dime.</p><h3 id="Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal"><a href="#Guide-to-Free-iPhone-Blacklist-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal"></a>Guide to Free iPhone Blacklist Removal</h3><p>The <strong>iPhone blacklist removal</strong> method is relatively easy. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone SE is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone SE ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone SE. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone SE device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

I know you’re supposed to connect it to the computer and put it in recovery mode but when I do, it says “unlock Apple iPhone X to use accessories.”</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/unlock-new/unlock-usb/unlock-iPhone-to-use-accessories.png"                      alt="unlock-iPhone-to-use-accessories"                ></p><p>You may have had the experience of connecting your Apple iPhone X to a computer with USB accessories. Usually, “<strong>Unlock Apple iPhone X to use accessories</strong>“ will appear on the screen. In most cases, enter the passcode to unlock the phone, and you can then proceed with data transfer and management. What to do if you forget your screen lock passcode? Here come the most effective methods for you!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-You-Need-to-“Unlock-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Use-Accessories”"><a href="#Part-1-Why-You-Need-to-“Unlock-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Use-Accessories”" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why You Need to “Unlock Apple iPhone X to Use Accessories”?"></a>Part 1: Why You Need to “Unlock Apple iPhone X to Use Accessories”?</h2><p>The command comes from Apple’s significant privacy safeguard <strong>“USB Restricted Mode”</strong>. It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only. Simply put, when your Apple iPhone X is locked for more than an hour, it needs to be unlocked to allow the connection of USB accessories. Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone X screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.</p><p>In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers. To combat hackers including GrayKey and protect iOS users’ data security, the USB Restricted Mode feature arrived with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018 and be improved in iOS12.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Disable-USB-Restricted-Mode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Disable-USB-Restricted-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Disable USB Restricted Mode?"></a>Part 2: How to Disable USB Restricted Mode?</h2><p>If you find this warning annoying or your Apple iPhone X not charging when using USB accessories, disabling USB Restricted Mode is an optional solution. However, you have to remember the unlock passcode. All the steps will be presented to you next.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your Apple iPhone X.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on <strong>Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong> (or <strong>Touch ID &amp; Passcode</strong>), and then input your screen passcode.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the page and find “<strong>USB accessories</strong>“ in the “<strong>Allow access when locked</strong>“ column.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click <strong>the toggle button on the right</strong> to disable this feature.</li></ul><p>After completing all the steps, your Apple iPhone X can connect USB accessories anytime, anywhere. However, it is very common to forget to unlock the passcode. Next, we will recommend four solutions to help you use USB accessories without a passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/unlock-new/unlock-usb/usb-restricted-mode.png"                      alt="usb-restricted-mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Use-USB-Accessories-without-Passcode-via-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Use-USB-Accessories-without-Passcode-via-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Unlock Apple iPhone X to Use USB Accessories without Passcode via Dr.Fone?"></a>Part 3: How to Unlock Apple iPhone X to Use USB Accessories without Passcode via Dr.Fone?</h2><p>Now, here comes an amazing App with many benefits to solving the problem for you.  This is Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock, which is very convenient and fast to use.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option. The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone X and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone X and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone X to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone X in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone X device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone X device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update. We highly recommend the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) since the software makes the whole process incredibly easy, especially when managing any problems you may have on your iOS device!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-the-required-apple-store-verification-for-apple-iphone-7-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For Apple iPhone 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-12-mini-passcode-without-itunes-without-knowing-passcode-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 12 mini Passcode without iTunes without Knowing Passcode?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-unlock-apple-iphone-12-pro-with-itunes-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Full Guide to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro with iTunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-15-plus-without-passcode-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 15 Plus Without Passcode?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-country-on-app-store-for-apple-iphone-11-with-7-methods-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Change Country on App Store for Apple iPhone 11 With 7 Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/did-your-iphone-15-pro-passcode-change-itself-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Did Your iPhone 15 Pro Passcode Change Itself?

Get Answers here"></a>What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 13 i Do? Get Answers here</h2><p>Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 13 removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>. Let’s start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone devices back view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?"></a>Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?</h2><p>Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13, it’s crucial to understand, “<strong>What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone</strong>?” While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 13:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 13 based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 13 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 13:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 13’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 13, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 13 to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>, leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password"></a>Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password</h2><p>Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 13. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It’s user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.</p><p>Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:</p><ul><li>Can remove all types of locked screen</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html"><u>Remove SIM lock</u></a>&#x2F; unlock iPhone carrier without losing data</li><li>Unlock Apple ID without a password</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>Bypass MDM without data loss</u></a></li><li>Remove iTunes backup encryption</li></ul><p>Dr.Fone uses the responsible path of jailbreaking your iOS device, giving you back control.

This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here’s how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone XS:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone XS to the computer and launch the iTunes application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press and hold down the ‘Volume’ and ‘Power’ buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode.

To increase your chances of success and avoid potential pitfalls, consider the following tips:</p><h3 id="1-Check-Device-Eligibility"><a href="#1-Check-Device-Eligibility" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Device Eligibility"></a>1. Check Device Eligibility</h3><p>Make sure your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is eligible for unlocking using the methods mentioned in this article. Different ways may have specific requirements or limitations, so verify compatibility beforehand. For example, if you want to use iCloud to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Plus 14, you need to have Find My enabled on the targeted device. For iTunes, you need to have the latest version of iTunes installed.</p><h3 id="2-Backup-Your-Data"><a href="#2-Backup-Your-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Backup Your Data"></a>2. Backup Your Data</h3><p>Using all the methods mentioned in this article will result in data loss. It is an important reminder that you should always create backups of your important data. If you are unsatisfied with native backup methods on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an excellent alternative. With it, you can create backups on your computer whenever you want using a one-click procedure.</p><p>If you find the manual backing up hectic, Wondershare Dr.Fone permits you to create an automatic incremental backup on your computer. These backups are done wirelessly at your specified time when both devices are connected to the same network.</p><h3 id="3-Understand-Terms-and-Conditions"><a href="#3-Understand-Terms-and-Conditions" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand Terms and Conditions"></a>3. Understand Terms and Conditions</h3><p>Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions associated with the unlocking methods you plan to use. This includes any potential data loss, warranty implications, or risks involved. Be informed before proceeding. All unlocking methods, such as using iCloud’s Find My iPhone or restoring with iTunes, involve erasing your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s data.</p><p>Understand the potential data loss implications and ensure you have a recent backup to restore your data if needed. Moreover, you also need to ensure that you have the legal right to unlock the iPhone. Unlocking methods should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to unlock.</p><h3 id="4-Follow-Instructions-Carefully"><a href="#4-Follow-Instructions-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="4. Follow Instructions Carefully"></a>4. Follow Instructions Carefully</h3><p>Following the instructions provided for each unlocking method is crucial to increase your chances of successful unlocking. Read the instructions thoroughly before starting the unlocking process. Familiarize yourself with each step and ensure you understand them. Take note of any prerequisites, such as having the latest version of iTunes installed, enabling Find My iPhone, or establishing a stable internet connection.</p><p>Avoid skipping or rushing through any steps, and carefully perform each action as instructed. Pay attention to details, such as button combinations, specific software settings, or prompts that may appear on your device or computer screen.</p><h3 id="5-Troubleshooting-Common-Issues"><a href="#5-Troubleshooting-Common-Issues" class="headerlink" title="5. Troubleshooting Common Issues"></a>5. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone may encounter certain obstacles or issues along the way. First, you need to ensure that your Apple iPhone 15 Plus 14 actually needs unlocking. For example, in the case of Face ID, you are required to enter the passcode after a particular time. In the case of a simple Face ID, you will need to enter a password every 48 hours if it hasn’t been unlocked during this time.</p><p>When both Face IDs, such as simple and mask, are enabled, every successful attempt adds 6.5 hours to the time before you are required to enter a passcode. Moreover, always use original or MFi-Certified cables to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the computer.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To summarize, unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Plus can be daunting when you’ve forgotten your passcode or encounter Face ID issues.

Launch the Software on your PC</strong></p><p>After successfully installing Dr.Fone on your PC, open it and select the “Screen Unlock” tool from the main interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="select screen unlock"                ></p><p>Next, connect your locked phone to the system through a wired connection.

However, a few clients might worry that it’s not as secure as utilizing a PIN to open your phone. If that is the best case for you, you can follow this manual to disable Face ID and depend on a passcode.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step guide to the most effective method to switch off Face ID on the iPhone:</p><h3 id="1-Open-the-Settings-application"><a href="#1-Open-the-Settings-application" class="headerlink" title="1.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked.

Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone’s. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</p><ol><li>Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 11 Pro that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 11 Pro currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-X-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-X-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 11 Pro from being unlocked by thieves"></a>Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 11 Pro from being unlocked by thieves</h2><p>It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 11 Pro from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 11 Pro without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

Unfortunately, if you are experiencing this situation with your Apple iPhone 6, you must be looking to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode.</p><p>There are many ways to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode. You not only do it with the help of iPhone’s stock features like Find My Apple iPhone 6 or iTunes, but you can also use third-party methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 lock screen.</p><p>So, let’s get straight to the different methods to unlock the Apple iPhone 6 lock screen.</p><h2 id="4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#4-Easy-Methods-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>4 Easy Methods to Unlock Apple iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>Following are the four different methods to unlock Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes"><a href="#Method-1-Unlock-iPhone-Screen-Passcode-With-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes"></a>Method #1: Unlock iPhone Screen Passcode With iTunes</h3><p>Unlocking an iPhone through iTunes is one of the most common ways. If you have forgotten your Apple iPhone 6 passcode, you can use iTunes to erase your device and reset it to its factory settings. This will remove the passcode, but it will also delete all of your data. If your device has a backup, you can use iTunes to restore your data after erasing your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="using itunes to unlock iphone"                ></p><p>Follow the steps to do this.</p><ol><li>First, connect your Apple iPhone 6 to your computer and launch iTunes. You will have to install it if you don’t have it on your computer. For installation, <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/itunes" >click here and download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Once you launch iTunes, you see few devices available to connect. So, select your device from the list.</li><li>Now you will have two options under your Apple iPhone 6’s specifications. So you will have to click on the other option named <strong>Restore iPhone</strong>.</li><li>By clicking this button, you will be asked again for confirmation. After confirmation, iTunes will wipe out everything on your Apple iPhone 6, and once the process is completed, you will be able to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 XR lock screen without any passcode.</li></ol><h3 id="Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Method-2-Unlock-It-Via-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone"></a>Method #2: Unlock It Via Find My iPhone</h3><p>If the above-given method is not helpful or you haven’t used iTunes before, we have another solution. You can use the “Find My iPhone” feature to erase your device and unlock it. This is useful when you quickly want to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 without a passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-x-xr-without-passcode-2.jpg"                      alt="using find my iphone to unlock iphone"                ></p><p>All you have to do is follow the steps given below.</p><ol><li>Log in to <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/" >the iCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website on your MacBook or Computer.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours.

Use Find My</h3><p>Utilizing iCloud if the Find My feature is enabled before you <strong>forgot iPhone passcode</strong>. By visiting iCloud.com, you can erase your Apple iPhone 8 Plus from a distance. Moreover, you can eliminate the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device’s screen lock to unlock it.</p><p>To erase the passcode using the Find My feature on iCloud:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to iCloud.com and enter your Apple account credentials and log in to your account.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pick “Find iPhone” and go to “All Devices” &gt; “Erase iPhone”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="find my"                ></p><h3 id="2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Use-Recovery-Mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes"></a>2. Use Recovery Mode with iTunes</h3><p>How to bypass the Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode or eliminate the passcode? The method is to utilize iTunes. However, using iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 8 Plus in recovery mode will erase all data from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device.</p><p>It will wipe out the iDevice. Therefore, you must back up your data to restore it later. Without any backup accessible, you will permanently lose everything on the iDevice.</p><p>Additionally, ensure you remember the Mac ID credentials on the iDevice, or you won’t be able to use it. Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen’s passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn’t so hard. Here’s how to bypass the Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode with iTunes:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Enter the recovery mode on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, iPad, or iPod Contact.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>On iPhone 8&#x2F;8 Or later:</strong> Hold the Power&#x2F;Side button on your phone and one of the volume buttons. Keep holding until the power off slider shows up. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 8 Plus transforms into the recovery mode screen.</li><li><strong>On iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Or Below:</strong> Press and hold the power button until you see the slider. Flip the slider to switch off the iPhone. Press the Volume Down button and connect the Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.</strong></p><p>After connecting your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes saying, “There is an issue with the ‘iPhone name’ that needs it to be restored.” In that window, select “Restore” to erase the iPhone. (If iTunes doesn’t run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up iPhone.</strong></p><p>Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="itunes unlock"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option"><a href="#3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option" class="headerlink" title="3. “Erase iPhone” Option"></a>3. “Erase iPhone” Option</h3><p>However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><p>After several wrong attempts, an “Erase iPhone” choice will appear on the screen’s lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.</p><p>If the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device can’t connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 8 Plus cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Siri"><a href="#4-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Siri"></a>4. Use Siri</h3><p>You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 8 Plus passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that’s just the beginning.</p><p>That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.</p><p>To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the “Home” button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Advise Siri to set a reminder.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Tap the recently added reminder to open the “Reminders” application.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “Home” button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="use siri"                ></p><p>As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.</p><h3 id="5-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#5-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="5. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>5. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>The Apple iPhone 8 Plus unlock software Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will help to open the password without iTunes. It is well-versed in unlocking screen locks from various iOS devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod contact. With it introduced on your PC, you can eliminate your Apple iPhone 8 Plus lock screen effectively. It can remove the 4-digit password, 6-digit password, Fingerprint, or Face ID.</p><p>Therefore, Dr.Fone is a decent option if you like to sidestep the passcode on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus without Siri or iTunes. To fix more issues, such as bypassing the enactment lock without the past proprietor, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will be a decent option for you. The following steps illustrate how you can unlock your lock screen passcode:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 8 Plus&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone program on your PC and select “Screen Unlock” among all the options from the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="select screen unlock"                ></p><p>Connect your iOS device to the PC through a USB connector. Then, at that point, click the “Unlock iOS Screen” option on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="unlock ios screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone 8 Plus lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can’t actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="enter recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 15. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 15 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 15 is locked now. What to do? Read on.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Locked"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-15-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Locked?"></a>Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 15 Locked?</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 15 is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 15 from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn’t for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 15, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 15 and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.</p><p>We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 15 does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked.

Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15 is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 15 ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 15. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 15 device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

We know forgetting your Apple iPhone 15 Pro passcode can be a frustrating experience, but luckily it is possible to unlock your device. Using different methods, we will show you how to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro 6 with a forgotten passcode.</p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode"></a>Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode</h2><p>Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we’ll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My iPhone"></a>1. Use Find My iPhone</h3><p>If you’ve activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn’t require any technical knowledge or special tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg"                      alt="find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro"                ></p><p>Just follow the steps below and get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com&#x2F;find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “All Devices” at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 15 Pro from the list of devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Erase iPhone” and confirm that you want to erase your device.</li></ul><p>Once your Apple iPhone 15 Pro has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes"></a>2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone 15 Pro with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the “Restore” or “Update” appears, please choose “Restore”.</li></ul><p>iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it’s finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Siri"><a href="#3-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Siri"></a>3. Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</li></ul><p>While this method doesn’t give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device’s features.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned methods works for you, or you don’t want to use them, there is another method that will surely work for you.

This is not just a random step; there’s a solid reason behind it.</p><p>The primary reason Apple requires verification for App Store purchases is to ensure that you are the person authorizing the purchase. This security measure prevents unauthorized transactions and protects your account from fraud.</p><p>What does this verification usually involve?

If you’ve just created a new Apple ID and need to download or pay for apps, Apple must verify your payment information. Thus, you’ll have to prove everything, especially on a new phone.</li><li>**Payment method needs to be corrected.**Suppose there’s an issue with your Apple ID’s payment method, such as outdated or incorrect details. In that case, verification is required to ensure the account is secure and ready for transactions.</li><li><strong>Invalid credit card</strong>.

If there’s an outstanding balance on your Apple ID, you can download or pay for new apps once this balance is cleared.</li><li><strong>Family Sharing restrictions</strong>.

This was an aftermarket app to help you through the process. However, if you want to achieve the same result the Apple way, do the following:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect the Apple iPhone 6 to the computer with the cable and launch iTunes or Finder (macOS Catalina and above).</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the volume up key on your Apple iPhone 6 and release. Then, press the volume down key and release.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 6 and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 6 device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 6 devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 6 device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.</p><h2 id="Part-III-FAQs"><a href="#Part-III-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part III: FAQs"></a>Part III: FAQs</h2><p>Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled"><a href="#FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?"></a>FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?</h3><p>iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.</p><h3 id="FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss"><a href="#FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?"></a>FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?</h3><p>Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 6 device.
