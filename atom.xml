Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.</p><p>Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone. Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt=" ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode.

The program will do its thing, and when it’s done, the software will say you’re able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 13 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p>That’s how easy Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) makes the entire unlock process!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt=" drfone advanced unlock"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes"><a href="#2-3-Restore-an-old-backup-from-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes"></a>2.3 Restore an old backup from iTunes</h3><p>Another key way that some users have found to unlock their device after an update is to restore their device to an older version, aiming to put your device back into a position where it didn’t have a lock screen.</p><p>It’s only possible to do this if you’ve backed up your iOS device in the past (which is why you’re encouraged to back up regularly), and it can all be done through the iTunes software on either your Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 13 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 13 to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 13 in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 13 device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 13 device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 13 backup unlocking never set by you.</p><p>But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let’s talk about them.</p><h2 id="Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.</p><p>One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone"></a>1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 13 backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 13 backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 13 backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 13, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 13 using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 13 to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 13 device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone 13 will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won’t take a lot of time at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png"                      alt="checking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 backup never set in the first place!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png"                      alt="removed"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone 13 backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 13. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to “Reset All Settings” on your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p>Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 13 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 13 is locked now. What to do? Read on.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-13-Locked"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-13-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 13 Locked?"></a>Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 13 Locked?</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 13 is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 13 from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn’t for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 13, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 13 and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.</p><p>We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 13 does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).</p><h3 id="II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-13"><a href="#II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 13"></a>II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 13</h3><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge is required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Dr.Fone is a set of modules that make life easy for you.

If for some reason you are unable to boot into Recovery Mode, there are instructions at the bottom to enter DFU mode.</p><p>Step 6: Dr.Fone will tell you the phone model and the software installed on it. If it is incorrect, use the dropdown lists to select the correct information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="device model"                ></p><p>Click Download to download the firmware file for your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="download firmware"                ></p><p>Step 7: Select the firmware package after the download completes. After the download completes, you can click Unlock Now to start unlocking the Apple iPhone 13.</p><p>In a short while, your Apple iPhone 13 will be unlocked. It is important to note that unlocking a locked Apple iPhone 13 cannot be done without wiping data.</p><h3 id="II-II-How-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-with-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#II-II-How-to-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-with-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 with Find My (iPhone)"></a>II.II How to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 with Find My (iPhone)</h3><p>Find My allows you to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 remotely if you want to. So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 13, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 13 device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 13, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 13.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 13 and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 13 and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 13 was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.</p><h3 id="II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-13-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-13-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="II.III Put The Apple iPhone 13 in Recovery Mode"></a>II.III Put The Apple iPhone 13 in Recovery Mode</h3><p>You can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 using Recovery Mode, yourself.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the computer and open iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder.</p><p>Step 2: Press the volume up button and let go. Press the volume down button and let go. Press the side button (power button) and keep holding it till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="press volume botton"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 13 and unlock Apple iPhone 13.</p><h2 id="Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-13"><a href="#Part-III-How-to-Turn-Off-Passcodes-in-Apple-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 13"></a>Part III: How to Turn Off Passcodes in Apple iPhone 13</h2><p>If after reading all this and going through so much hassle to unlock the Apple iPhone 13, you feel that passcodes are not worth your time, we feel you. We designed Dr.Fone to help you be at ease and be safe with passcodes for when you forget them, but if you would rather not use passcodes at all, we understand where you’re coming from. Here is how to turn off passcodes for good on Apple iPhone 13:</p><p>Step 1: Launch Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll down to Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 3: Enter your passcode.</p><p>Step 4: Scroll down and select Turn Passcode Off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="turn passcode off"                ></p><p>Step 5: Enter your passcode one last time.</p><p>You’re done. Now go ahead and forget the passcode forever. You will not need it again. Do note, however, that not using a passcode on your Apple iPhone 13 leaves not only your data but your Apple iPhone 13 itself in a highly vulnerable state. Anyone with access to your device can do anything on the Apple iPhone 13 device that you could, including setting up a passcode that you will then have to use this guide to unlock.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-More-information-about-Apple-iPhone-13-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro"><a href="#Part-IV-More-information-about-Apple-iPhone-13-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;Apple iPhone 13 mini&#x2F;Apple iPhone 13 Pro"></a>Part IV: More information about Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;Apple iPhone 13 mini&#x2F;Apple iPhone 13 Pro</h2><p>The ways mentioned before should help you get out of the locked Apple iPhone 13 now.

Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 13</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination. The time span that was once calculated in days has now shrunk to just a few hours. In the early days, no one would have imagined that they could carry the computer in small bags, but laptops were invented to their surprise.</p><p>Today, all those computer and laptop qualities are being shifted into a small phone. Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value. Talking about iPhone, let’s discuss how a user can unlock Apple iPhone 13 without a passcode.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn6H3w08kAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-without-Passcode-or-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-1-Unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-without-Passcode-or-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 13 device in question.

Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working.

(If iTunes doesn’t run, open iTunes by double tapping it.)</p><p><strong>Step 3. Set up iPhone.</strong></p><p>Hang tight for the process to wrap up. Then, a short time later, go to your Apple iPhone 13 and follow the on-screen directions to set up and utilize your phone again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="itunes unlock"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option"><a href="#3-“Erase-iPhone”-Option" class="headerlink" title="3. “Erase iPhone” Option"></a>3. “Erase iPhone” Option</h3><p>However long the locked iPhone has a functioning WiFi connection, you can now delete the Apple iPhone 13 device from the lock screen. This method only works if it is running iOS 15.2 or above.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><p>After several wrong attempts, an “Erase iPhone” choice will appear on the screen’s lower part. Just tap on that, confirm you need to erase the Apple iPhone 13 and enter your Apple ID details afterward. The device will then reset itself, completely deleting all data and beginning as a new one.</p><p>If the Apple iPhone 13 device can’t connect to WiFi or data, the Apple ID approval step will fail. Then the Apple iPhone 13 cannot be erased, and you will need to turn to the conventional DFU strategy.</p><h3 id="4-Use-Siri"><a href="#4-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Siri"></a>4. Use Siri</h3><p>You can also use Siri to bypass the Apple iPhone 13 passcode. Using Siri to erase the lock is an iPhone hack existing on iOS devices running iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. You can utilize Siri to bypass your Apple iPhone 13 passcode by switching off cellular data. You also need to read a new message and set a reminder, and that’s just the beginning.</p><p>That is an indirect method for bypassing a forgotten passcode on iPhone. In any case, it is just available on a few iOS variants.</p><p>To erase the lock screen passcode with Siri on iOS 8 to iOS 10.1:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the “Home” button to actuate Siri on your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Advise Siri to set a reminder.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Tap the recently added reminder to open the “Reminders” application.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “Home” button and go to the Home screen. Presently you have effectively bypassed the lock screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-on-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="use siri"                ></p><p>As you might be aware, this way is helpful because of iOS bugs. This method is also viewed as a method for hacking the iPhone. In later iOS versions, Apple fixed these bugs. In this manner, it works on iPhones running iOS 8.0 to 10.1.</p><h3 id="5-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#5-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="5. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>5. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>The Apple iPhone 13 unlock software Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will help to open the password without iTunes. It is well-versed in unlocking screen locks from various iOS devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod contact. With it introduced on your PC, you can eliminate your Apple iPhone 13 lock screen effectively. It can remove the 4-digit password, 6-digit password, Fingerprint, or Face ID.</p><p>Therefore, Dr.Fone is a decent option if you like to sidestep the passcode on your Apple iPhone 13 without Siri or iTunes. To fix more issues, such as bypassing the enactment lock without the past proprietor, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock will be a decent option for you. The following steps illustrate how you can unlock your lock screen passcode:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone program on your PC and select “Screen Unlock” among all the options from the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="select screen unlock"                ></p><p>Connect your iOS device to the PC through a USB connector. Then, at that point, click the “Unlock iOS Screen” option on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="unlock ios screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery or DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before sidestepping the Apple iPhone 13 lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen directions. Therefore, the Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. Yet, if you can’t actuate the Recovery mode, you can also use the DFU mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="enter recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Affirm iOS device information</strong></p><p>After putting the Apple iPhone 13 device in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 13 device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 13 device Model and OS Variant. You can choose the correct data from the dropdown menu if the information is incorrect. Then, at that point, click Download to download the firmware for your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="select phone model"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 13 screen lock</strong></p><p>After the firmware is downloaded effectively, click Unlock Now to begin unlocking your Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;iPad.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="unlock now"                ></p><p>Simply shortly, your Apple iPhone 13 will be unlocked effectively. Note that this unlocking process will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 13. However, it is practical to erase this issue from your device.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Turn-Off-On-My-Passcode"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Turn-Off-On-My-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Turn Off&#x2F;On My Passcode?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Turn Off&#x2F;On My Passcode?</h2><ul><li>Open your Settings application and look down until you track down the choice for the password menu.

But have you encountered the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed-out</strong> dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 13 or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 13 or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 13 device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes.

Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn <strong>how to remove Face ID</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13 X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-I-What-is-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-I-What-is-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: What is Face ID?"></a>Part I: What is Face ID?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><p>If the new Apple iPhone 13 is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 13 from the 6&#x2F;7&#x2F;8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.</p><p>Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 13 13, the Apple iPhone 13 14, and now the Apple iPhone 13 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.</p><p>Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 13 device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 13 device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-13"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 13"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 13</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 13 in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.</p><p>Step 5: When done, tap Done.</p><p>In case you are getting the following error:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg"                      alt="face id error"                ></p><p>There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone 13 device to the nearest service center.

However, it’s important to take steps to ensure that your iOS data remains safe during the process. Here are some tips to help you do just that:</p><ul><li><strong>Backup Your Files</strong></li></ul><p>Before you <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong>, create a <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup/backup-iphone-with-broken-screen.html"><u>backup of your data</u></a> so you don’t lose important files. You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.</p><p>Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you’re getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Password Check</strong></li></ul><p>Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid Sharing an Apple ID</strong></li></ul><p>It’s best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></li></ul><p>If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It’s simple and highly effective.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Changing your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other iOS devices is a simple process that can help you protect your privacy and information. With the tips above, you can ensure your iOS data is safe and secure during the switch.</p><p>And if you need to remove your Apple ID without a password, Dr.Fone is a good option. Dr.Fone is a powerful iOS toolkit that can help you with various phone solutions. It’s easy to use and can help you solve mobile problems in just a few minutes.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-different-methods-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Different Methods To Unlock Your Apple iPhone XS Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/what-does-jailbreaking-iphone-7-plus-i-do-get-answers-here-by-drfone-ios/"><u>What Does Jailbreaking iPhone 7 Plus i Do?

This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 13 to a Windows&#x2F; macOS device and launch iTunes.

They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 13 with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 13 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 13.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 13 and return the Apple iPhone 13 device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 13 is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 13 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 13 easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle.

So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 13 disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 13 device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-and-reset-face-id-on-iphone-se-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove and Reset Face ID on iPhone SE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-lock-stolen-your-iphone-se-2020-properly-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Learn How To Lock Stolen Your iPhone SE (2020) Properly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/disabling-iphone-6s-parental-restrictions-withwithout-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Disabling iPhone 6s Parental Restrictions With/Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/unlocking-apple-iphone-7-plus-lock-screen-3-foolproof-methods-that-actually-work-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Unlocking Apple iPhone 7 Plus Lock Screen 3 Foolproof Methods that Actually Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-easy-ways-to-factory-reset-a-locked-apple-iphone-6-without-itunes-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Easy Ways to Factory Reset a Locked Apple iPhone 6 Without iTunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-iphone-8-plus-lock-screen-with-notifications-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Make the Most of Your iPhone 8 Plus Lock Screen with Notifications?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-13-pro-without-swiping-up-6-ways-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Unlock Apple iPhone 13 Pro Without Swiping Up? 6 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-disabled-iphone-15-pro-max-how-to-unlock-a-disabled-iphone-15-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Disabled iPhone 15 Pro Max How to Unlock a Disabled iPhone 15 Pro Max?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-iphone-12-pro-max-backup-password-heres-what-to-do-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Forgot iPhone 12 Pro Max Backup Password?

Finally, utilizing iTunes will eliminate the lock screen’s passcode but not the firmware. Considering all these, bypassing a passcode isn’t so hard.

This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 13 or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 13 device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.

We know forgetting your Apple iPhone 13 passcode can be a frustrating experience, but luckily it is possible to unlock your device. Using different methods, we will show you how to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 6 with a forgotten passcode.</p><p>So let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode"><a href="#Top-3-Ways-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Forgotten-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode"></a>Top 3 Ways to Unlock iPhone 6 without Forgotten Passcode</h2><p>Your iPhone passcode can be reset in a variety of ways, depending on whether you have a backup. Below, we’ll go over the three most common methods for resetting an iPhone passcode.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#1-Use-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Find My iPhone"></a>1. Use Find My iPhone</h3><p>If you’ve activated Find My iPhone, you can use it to reset your passcode. Resetting your passcode this way is probably the simplest method, as it doesn’t require any technical knowledge or special tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-1.jpg"                      alt="find My Apple iPhone 13"                ></p><p>Just follow the steps below and get started.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Via a computer or other iOS devices, go to icloud.com&#x2F;find and sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “All Devices” at the top of the screen and find out your Apple iPhone 13 from the list of devices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Erase iPhone” and confirm that you want to erase your device.</li></ul><p>Once your Apple iPhone 13 has been erased, it can be set up as a new device and you can choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes"><a href="#2-Unlock-it-via-Recovery-mode-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes"></a>2. Unlock it via Recovery mode with iTunes</h3><p>You can use Recovery mode to reset your device if you’ve synced your Apple iPhone 13 with iTunes. This method will erase all of the data on your Apple iPhone 13, so confirm you have a backup before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-2.jpg"                      alt="with itunes"                ></p><p>Just go with the steps below.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 13 to a computer and turn on iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> While your Apple iPhone 13 is connected, restart it by pressing and holding the Sleep&#x2F;Wake and Home buttons simultaneously. Keep holding these buttons until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the “Restore” or “Update” appears, please choose “Restore”.</li></ul><p>iTunes will now begin downloading the software for your device. Once it’s finished, you can set up your device as new and choose a new passcode.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Siri"><a href="#3-Use-Siri" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Siri"></a>3. Use Siri</h3><p>If you’re running iOS 8 or later, you may be able to use Siri to bypass the lock screen. This method doesn’t work on all devices, and it can be patched with a software update, so it’s not a guaranteed way to reset your passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgot-passcode-iphone-6-3.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><p>Just follow the instructions.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press and hold the Home button to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Say something like “Siri, what time is it?” or “Siri, who am I?”</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will likely respond with an error message saying that she can’t answer these questions while your device is locked. However, she will also give you the option to “Tap to open Clock”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap on “Clock,” and you’ll be taken to the Clock app. From here, you can access other apps like Calendar, Reminders, and more.</li></ul><p>While this method doesn’t give you direct access to the home screen, it does allow you to bypass the lock screen and access some of your device’s features.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Easy-Tool-to-Unlock-iPhone-6-without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode"></a>Bonus Tips: Easy Tool to Unlock iPhone 6 without Passcode</h2><p>If none of the above-mentioned methods works for you, or you don’t want to use them, there is another method that will surely work for you. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock is a powerful software that can unlock your Apple iPhone 13 without a passcode. The software is extremely easy to use and supports all iOS devices.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Unlock iPhone Without Passcode</p><ul><li>Unlock Face ID, Touch ID, Apple ID without password.</li><li>Bypass the iCloud activation lock without hassle.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li><li>Remove iPhone carrier restrictions for unlimited usage.</li><li>No tech knowledge required, Simple, click-through, process.</li></ul><p><strong>3,981,454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h3 id="How-To-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Passcode-Using-Dr-Fone"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Passcode-Using-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock iPhone Without Passcode Using Dr.Fone?"></a>How To Unlock iPhone Without Passcode Using Dr.Fone?</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you have Dr.Fone on your PC, then launch the program and select “Screen Unlock”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-1.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the computer, you require a USB cable.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Follow the instructions below to put your device in DFU or Recovery mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="dfu mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once your device enters into DFU mode or Recovery mode, Dr.Fone will ask you to choose the right firmware for your Apple iPhone 13 6.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Upon selecting the right firmware, Dr.Fone will start downloading the firmware for your device. Once it’s finished, click “Unlock Now” to remove the passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="complete firmware"                ></p><p>You need to wait as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don’t interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your Apple iPhone 13. Once the process is completed, your Apple iPhone 13 will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="unlock iphone successfully"                ></p><p>This is a very easy-to-use way to reset your Apple iPhone 13 passcode. So, if you’re looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should obtain.</p><p>As we told you earlier, any method you follow will lose your data, as there is no way to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 6 without losing the data. So, how can you back up your Apple iPhone 13 to avoid forgetting the passcode?

Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.</p><h2 id="Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?"></a>Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?</h2><p>Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode.

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 13 X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 13 and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 13 device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 13 device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-13"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 13"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 13</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 13 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 13 in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.</p><p>Step 5: When done, tap Done.</p><p>In case you are getting the following error:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg"                      alt="face id error"                ></p><p>There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone 13 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone 13 device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone 13 (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone 13 can be used solely with passcodes if you want.

Learn the Best Methods To Unlock"></a>Forgot Locked Apple iPhone 13 Password? Learn the Best Methods To Unlock</h2><p>The note-taking apps are pivotal in organizing thoughts, reminders, and sensitive data. Notably, Apple’s Notes app stands out for smooth blending into the Apple ecosystem while boasting a user-friendly interface. It is recognized for its effortless integration and robust security.</p><p>This app offers a reliable and secure platform for storing personal and confidential information. Users can safeguard their notes by setting up separate passwords. Yet, it’s not uncommon to encounter a situation where one <strong>forgets a note password on an iPhone</strong>. This can be frustrating, but don’t worry, as this article will discuss <strong>how to unlock a note on iPhone.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-forgot-notes-password-1.jpg"                      alt="unlock forgotten notes password easily"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Method-To-Unlock-Forgotten-Notes-Password-iPhone-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Method-To-Unlock-Forgotten-Notes-Password-iPhone-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Best Method To Unlock Forgotten Notes Password iPhone: Wondershare Dr.Fone</h2><p>Apple allows users to create a separate password for notes or use their iPhone passcode. Many users choose the second option to avoid remembering a new password.

Here’s what you need to do when you <strong>forgot iPhone PIN</strong>:</p><ul><li>Please enter your password a few times from your device’s Lock Screen until it requests that you attempt another time. Then repeat this activity until you see the Erase iPhone choice in the corner of the screen.</li><li>Tap Erase iPhone, then click again to confirm your activity.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-1.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><ul><li>Enter your Apple account details to sign out of your Apple ID on the phone.</li><li>Tap Erase iPhone back to erase all your user data and settings for all time.</li><li>At the point when the iOS device restarts, adhere to the on-screen directions.

Now set a new password for your device.</li></ul><p><strong>Instructions to Restore a Locked iPhone Running iOS 15.1 or Prior</strong></p><ul><li>To begin with, put your Apple iPhone 13 into DFU recovery mode.</li><li>Then, connect it to a PC or Macintosh through a Lightning link.</li><li>Select your Apple iPhone 13 in the Finder sidebar on Mac or iTunes on the PC.</li><li>Pick Restore when you see the choice to Restore. Let the download finish if the download takes over 15 minutes and your device leaves the recovery mode screen. Then, at that point, turn off your Apple iPhone 13 and start once more.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-2.jpg"                      alt="click restore"                ></p><ul><li>Disconnect your Apple iPhone 13, then, at that point, turn it on and set it up. That’s all you need to do.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-Find-My-iPhone-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-Use-Find-My-iPhone-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud"></a>2. Use Find My iPhone in iCloud</h3><p>Apple allows clients to erase iPhone data to safeguard it from others remotely. However, your lock screen can still protect your data if you don’t erase the iPhone. No one can unlock the screen unless they enter the correct password. After too many wrong password attempts, your Apple iPhone 13 will be locked. So no one can then touch your user data.</p><p>If you have enabled the “Find My” option before <strong>forgotten iPhone PIN</strong>, there is a chance for you to remove the lock. That is to utilize iCloud.</p><p>To unlock iPhone through iCloud:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Visit the iCloud.com web page and log in with your Apple ID and passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the “Find iPhone” option from the different choices available.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Click “All Devices” and pick the Apple iPhone 13 device you need to unlock.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “Erase iPhone” button. Subsequently, set up the Apple iPhone 13 device and set another lock screen PIN. With iCloud, you can unlock your iDevice without even touching your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/forgotten-iphone-pin-3.jpg"                      alt="icloud unlock"                ></p><h3 id="3-Unlock-it-with-iTunes"><a href="#3-Unlock-it-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="3. Unlock it with iTunes"></a>3. Unlock it with iTunes</h3><p>Suppose you use iTunes to restore the Apple iPhone 13 in recovery mode; it will install the latest iOS to your device. Doing so will erase all user data from the Apple iPhone 13 device, including the lock screen. So, this is also an excellent way to unlock your Apple iPhone 13. However, you must keep a backup of your important files before doing so.</p><p>Utilizing iTunes will wipe out the iPhone. You can restore the data from there if you have a previous backup. If you have nothing, you will lose every data on the iPhone.</p><p>Additionally, ensure that you keep your iDevices’ Apple ID details safe. Else, you will not have the option to use the iDevice again. Using iTunes will erase the screen’s password but not the firmware. Considering that, you must keep the information in mind to set up and utilize the Apple iPhone 13 device.</p><p>To sidestep iPhone password with iTunes:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Go to Recovery mode</strong></p><p><strong>On iPhone 8&#x2F;8 Or more and Above:</strong> Hold the power&#x2F;side button and press any of the volume buttons until a slider appears. Move the slider to turn off the Apple iPhone 13 device. Next, press and hold the power button and connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the PC. Hold the button until the Apple iPhone 13 device shows the recovery mode screen.</p><p><strong>On iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Or Below:</strong> Press and hold the power button until you see the power off slider. Next, move the slider to turn off the iPhone. Then, press the Volume (-) button and connect the Apple iPhone 13 device to the PC. Continue to hold the button until you see the recovery mode screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Restore your Apple iPhone 13.</strong></p><p>After you connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the PC, you will see a popup window in iTunes. It will warn about an issue with the “Your iPhone name” and ask you to restore it. In that window, select “Restore” to erase the iPhone.

Follow these steps for making an Emergency call on your <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock:</strong></p><ul><li>Click the “Emergency Call” option on your locked device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-3.jpg"                      alt="emergency call"                ></p><ul><li>Dial “*#96274825*0000*1#,” then, at that point, press and hold the dial button for 10 to 15 minutes.</li><li>If it’s not working, try changing the last digit from 1-9. If this doesn’t work, have a go at setting 0 after 9. Remember to hold the dial button.</li><li>Press Home, and it will return you to the beginning screen. Select the language and country, and the activation screen will never appear again. Now create a new password after <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#5-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="5. Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>5. Apple iPhone Unlock</h3><p>Apple iPhone Unlock is a site that can assist you with <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock</strong>. You must give them your Apple iPhone 13’s IMEI and model number to get their services.</p><p>The benefit of Apple iPhone Unlock is that they keep themselves updated with the latest technology. They are educated regarding their tool’s advancement by giving updates every time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-4.jpg"                      alt="apple iphone unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Critical Features of Apple iPhone Unlock:</strong></p><ul><li>As per their site, Apple iPhone Unlock can work with every one of the Apple iPhone 13 devices going from iPhone 4 to iPhone 14 Pro Max.</li><li>Don’t bother downloading anything to your PC or phone like others. Another iPhone lock screen expects you to download their tool or software to work.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-How-to-Unlock-Our-iPhone-Screen"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-How-to-Unlock-Our-iPhone-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: How to Unlock Our iPhone Screen?"></a>Bonus Tips: How to Unlock Our iPhone Screen?</h2><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p>An expert unlocking tool comes in handy when no other method works. In this case, we strongly suggest you use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is a reliable tool and has been in the market for a long time. Professional unlock service providers use it because of its ease of use and clean interface.</p><p>So, without looking any further, download this tool for a remarkable unlocking experience. The methods below will guide you into unlocking your Apple iPhone 13 within no time:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone software and tap the “Unlock iOS Screen.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery&#x2F;DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before bypassing the Apple iPhone 13 lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen guidelines. The Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. However, if you can’t activate the Recovery mode, you can figure out how to activate the DFU mode from their official site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Affirm Device Information</strong></p><p>After getting the phone in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 13 device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 13 model and other data. You can choose the right information from the dropdown menu if the information isn’t right. Then, at that point, download the firmware for your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="device information"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Screen Lock</strong></p><p>After downloading the required firmware effectively, click Unlock Now to remove the lock. However, note that this unlocking system will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 13. Truly, there is no answer for <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock</strong> without losing your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="unlocked successfully"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>You might forget the password used before placing your Apple iPhone 13 in Lost Mode. It is also likely to purchase a locked device, and then you can’t contact the owner to unlock it and don’t know your Apple ID details. Some might think this is a dead situation, and you can’t use the iPhone.</p><p>Luckily, we’re here to provide a series of dependable and secure solutions that will help your <strong>iPhone in Lost Mode unlock.</strong></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-14-pro-without-passcode-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 14 Pro Without Passcode?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-most-effective-methods-to-unlock-iphone-8-plus-in-lost-mode-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 5 Most Effective Methods to Unlock iPhone 8 Plus in Lost Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-many-attempts-to-unlock-iphone-15-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Many Attempts To Unlock iPhone 15 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-erase-iphone-8-when-its-locked-within-seconds-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Erase iPhone 8 When Its Locked Within Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-locked-apple-iphone-14-password-learn-the-best-methods-to-unlock-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Forgot Locked Apple iPhone 14 Password?

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 13:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 13 based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 13 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 13:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems.

Here’s the Fix"></a>Apple iPhone 13 Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking? Here’s the Fix</h2><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-iTunes-Ask-Me-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?"></a>Part 1: Why Do iTunes Ask Me for iPhone Backup Password?</h2><p>When you use iTunes to create a backup, the backup will probably have a password that iTunes automatically create. This is for privacy reasons. Hence, it might ask for an iTunes backup password never set by you!</p><p>In most cases, this occurs when the Encrypt Backup option is activated. As an official iOS feature, its purpose is to provide iOS users with the iTunes backup encryption for further security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-2.jpg"                      alt="encrypt local backup"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, this capability may also become problematic if you inadvertently take a backup without being able to provide the password. For example, you may have to enter the password for your Apple iPhone 13 backup unlocking never set by you.</p><p>But the good news is you have some possible fixes. So, let’s talk about them.</p><h2 id="Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-4-Possible-Ways-to-Fix-Asking-for-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 4 Possible Ways to Fix Asking for iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>Many iPhone users have problems with iTunes when they back up their devices.</p><p>One of the most common issues is that people are asked for their iPhone backup password never set, but they need to know what it is. This can be frustrating because you can only back up your device if you have the password.</p><p>There are a few possible ways to fix this problem. Try resetting your password or using a different computer to back up your device. You could also try using a third-party software tool like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-use-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone"></a>1. Try all passwords you use on iPhone</h3><p>When iTunes prompts you for an iPhone backup password never set, what should your initial course of action be?</p><p>To get out of this predicament in the simplest way possible, try entering every potential password you will likely have used. In most cases, individuals will use the same password for many accounts.</p><p>A significant possibility is that you encrypted the iTunes backup with the same password from the iCloud account.</p><p>Therefore, before doing anything further, try all passwords to configure your iTunes account. For example, try entering 0000, 123456, name123, or 1111.</p><h3 id="2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS"><a href="#2-Find-the-password-from-Keychain-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS"></a>2. Find the password from Keychain on macOS</h3><p>You may also attempt to find the password for the iTunes backup using the keychain approach if you are working on a Mac.</p><p>The likelihood of success with this approach is relatively low. However, it is still worthwhile to try it, particularly if you have also synchronized your iTunes account with your Mac.</p><ol><li>On your macOS, go to <strong>Utilities</strong> by clicking the <strong>Applications</strong> menu item. At this point, launch the <strong>Keychain Access app</strong> and look for your Apple iPhone 13 backup.</li><li>To open a new dialogue box, double-click the most recent backup file, and you will see one appear before you.</li><li>On this page, choose Show Password to get the password for the Apple iPhone 13 backup. However, you will first be prompted to provide the administrator password associated with your iCloud account to recover the password.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-3.jpg"                      alt="keychain"                ></p><h3 id="3-“Reset-All-Settings”"><a href="#3-“Reset-All-Settings”" class="headerlink" title="3. “Reset All Settings”"></a>3. “Reset All Settings”</h3><p>Resetting the password is another option at your disposal if you encounter the Apple iPhone 13 backup password never set problem. How you do this will be different depending on the version of iOS that you have installed.</p><p>Here are what you can do with your iOS smartphone if it has iOS 11 or a later version:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unlock your Apple iPhone 13, and then open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the <strong>General</strong> menu, go to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu and then hit the <strong>Reset All Settings</strong> button. Please confirm your action by providing the password for your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-4.jpg"                      alt="reset all settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the reset has been completed, your previous password will be deleted.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next thing you should do is take a fresh backup of your Apple iPhone 13 using iTunes, and then establish a new password for the backup that iTunes creates.</p><p>You will need to use an alternative strategy, which includes a factory reset if you use an older version of the iOS firmware than iOS 11.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before continuing, it is highly recommended that you create a backup of the data on your Apple iPhone 13 using iCloud.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you have opened the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to the <strong>General</strong> menu, then to the <strong>Reset</strong> menu, and finally to the <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/iphone-backup-password-never-set-5.jpg"                      alt="reset in settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirm that you want to reset your Apple iPhone 13 to factory settings, and wait until it is done.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the factory data reset is finished, you must restore your iCloud backup. To do this, follow the steps for setting up iOS until you reach the <strong>Apps &amp; Data</strong> option.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Create a new backup in iTunes and change the password for the existing backup in iTunes.</p><p>You should be aware that resetting the Apple iPhone 13 device to factory settings will not make your encrypted backups accessible again.</p><p>On the other hand, it does make it possible for you to generate a fresh backup in iTunes that is not encrypted.</p><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock"></a>4. Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> After installing Dr.Fone on your device, please run the program and look for the red button labeled <strong>“Screen Unlock.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While in the interface for <strong>Screen Unlock</strong>, navigate to the bottom right of the screen and tap on the feature labeled <strong>“Remove iTunes BackUp Encryption.”</strong> This will allow you to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When brought to this screen, please use a USB cord to connect your iOS device to your personal computer. If Dr.Fone can identify this relationship, the following picture will appear for you to see.</p><p>Please read the following three notes carefully before clicking the <strong>“Remove Now”</strong> button:</p><ul><li>Check to ensure that <strong>“Find My iPhone”</strong> is not turned on.</li><li>During this procedure, you should not launch <strong>“iTunes.”</strong></li><li>During the process, your Apple iPhone 13 will restart.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-3.png"                      alt="connected"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have an iTunes backup, Dr.Fone may automatically verify it and delete it. This encryption will be removed once the percentage on the progress meter reaches the end. This procedure won’t take a lot of time at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-4.png"                      alt="checking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The encryption of the iTunes backup has been successfully erased! Your backed-up data may be quickly restored, transferred, wiped clean, and backed up again. Hence, you can enter the password to unlock your Apple iPhone 13 backup never set in the first place!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-itunes-backup-encryption-5.png"                      alt="removed"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>There are four ways to fix the problem if iTunes keeps asking for your Apple iPhone 13 backup password. The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 13. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to “Reset All Settings” on your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p>Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to avoid the problem of iTunes backup password never set.</p><h2 id="How-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-13-iPad-Without-Computer"><a href="#How-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-13-iPad-Without-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;iPad Without Computer"></a>How to Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;iPad Without Computer</h2><p>Forgetting the Apple iPhone 13 or iPad passcode could be the worst nightmare for plenty of iOS users.

Surprisingly, you don’t need to take the assistance of a computer to unlock your iOS device. This guide will make you familiar with how to unlock the iPad passcode without a computer. Read on and learn how to unlock the disabled Apple iPhone 13 without a computer right away.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8CJ89bh90c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-unlock-disabled-Apple-iPhone-13-without-computer-using-Siri"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-unlock-disabled-Apple-iPhone-13-without-computer-using-Siri" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 13 without computer using Siri?"></a>Part 1: How to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 13 without computer using Siri?</h2><p>Accessing Siri is the first thing that comes to iOS users’ minds whenever they <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/get-into-locked-iphone.html" >get locked out of their Apple iPhone 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It might surprise you, but you can also take the assistance of Siri to unlock your phone. Most users prefer this technique, as it doesn’t require a computer and can unlock an iOS device without erasing its data.</p><p>Though, before you proceed, you need to know the limitations of this method. Since it is considered a loophole in iOS, it doesn’t always yield desirable results. It has been observed that the method only works on devices running from iOS 8.0 to iOS 10.1. To learn how to unlock iPad passcode without a computer, follow these stepwise instructions:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Activate Siri on your iOS device by holding the Home button. Ask for the present time by giving a command like “Hey Siri, what time is it?” to proceed. Siri will let you know the current time by displaying a clock. Tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463688829.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Tap on the Add (plus) icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994463891817.jpg"                      alt="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From here, you can search for a city.

These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 13 screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13 device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 13. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 13 lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 13.

Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center.

So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 13 with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either.

Whether getting region-specific apps, accessing exclusive content, or switching to a country with better app offerings, it’s a valuable capability.</p><p>The article below guides you through seven methods on <strong>how to change the country of your App Store</strong>.Following the guide ensures access to a world of apps and content tailored to your preferences. Keep reading the page below to achieve this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-app-store-country-01.jpg"                      alt="app store icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-1-Pros-and-Cons-of-Changing-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Changing Your App Store Country</h2><p><strong>Changing your App Store country on your Apple iPhone 13</strong> can offer various benefits, but it also comes with certain drawbacks. It’s necessary to consider the pros and cons before making this decision.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>**Access to Region-Specific Apps.**Different countries have unique apps tailored to their markets. By <strong>changing your App Store country</strong>, you can access apps that might not be available in your current region. For example, some popular Chinese and Japanese apps are unavailable in the US App Store. If you want to use these apps, you will need to <strong>change your App Store country</strong>.</li><li>**Getting App Updates.**Sometimes, apps receive updates and features in certain regions before others. <strong>Changing your App Store country</strong> can give you early access to these updates, improving your app experience. For example, a gaming app might first release new levels or features in select countries.</li><li>**Access Exclusive Content.**Some apps and content are exclusive to certain countries. By switching your App Store country, you can enjoy movies, music, or TV shows unavailable in your current region. For instance, certain Netflix shows are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>**Loss of Access to Purchases.**If you’ve made purchases in your current App Store country, changing it can result in losing access to those purchases. The loss includes paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. For example, if you switch from the US to the UK store, you may lose access to US-specific subscriptions.</li><li>**Offload Apps.**When you <strong>change your App Store country</strong>, your device may prompt you to offload apps that are not available in your new region. This can be inconvenient if you rely on specific apps for daily use. For instance, a banking app may be region-specific and unavailable in your new country.</li><li>**Family Sharing Issues.**If you’re part of a Family Sharing group, <strong>changing your App Store country</strong> can affect the access and sharing of purchased apps and subscriptions. Family members may lose access to content tied to your previous country. For example, if you switch from the UK to the US store, your family members might no longer have access to UK-specific content.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Methods-to-Change-Your-App-Store-Country" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

And how often should you change your Apple ID password? If it’s been a while since your last update, stay in this article to learn <strong>how to change your Apple ID password on your account</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-01.jpg"                      alt="change apple id password on web"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Your-Apple-ID-Safe-Watch-Out-for-These-Signs"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Your-Apple-ID-Safe-Watch-Out-for-These-Signs" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs"></a>Part 1: Is Your Apple ID Safe? Watch Out for These Signs</h2><p>Despite your best efforts, there’s always a risk of password compromise. If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.</p><p>They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That’s why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:</p><ul><li><strong>Frequent Login Requests</strong></li></ul><p>If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it’s a red flag. Someone may be trying to open your Apple account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-02.jpg"                      alt="apple id sign in request"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unexpected Purchases</strong></li></ul><p>Unexplained app or content purchases on your account may indicate unauthorized access. Review your purchase history regularly.</p><ul><li><strong>Password Reset Emails</strong></li></ul><p>Receiving emails notifying you of a password change when you didn’t make one is a major concern. It indicates unauthorized access attempts.</p><ul><li><strong>Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account</strong></li></ul><p>Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion. Phishing attempts often involve emails or messages that appear to be from Apple, asking for your login credentials. Be cautious and verify the source.</p><ul><li><strong>Difficult Logging In</strong></li></ul><p>To protect your account from unauthorized access, Apple may lock or disable your account if your password or other account information is entered incorrectly several times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-password-03.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked"                ></p><p>Now that you’re aware of these signs, it’s crucial to know <strong>how to change your Apple ID password</strong> to fortify your account’s security.

Or if it is even secure?</p><p>If so, you’re not alone. Millions of people use the same password for multiple accounts. That makes it easy for hackers to break into their accounts. And even if you use a different password for each account, it’s still important to change your passwords regularly. So, before you discover <strong>how to change your Apple ID password on your Apple account</strong>, here are three things you should consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Complexity</strong></li></ul><p>Vary the types of characters in your password to make it more complex and difficult to crack – mix the numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.</p><ul><li><strong>Uniqueness</strong></li></ul><p>Be creative, and don’t use publicly available information about you, such as your phone number or birthday.

You can track purchases and manage your account settings through your Apple ID. But what if you need a new one for security or moving to a new location?</p><p>Whatever the reason, learning <strong>how to change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> is straightforward. And this guide will show the steps and provide some tips at the end.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-01.jpg"                      alt="browsing on an ipad pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-Why-You-Might-Need-To-Change-Your-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-Why-You-Might-Need-To-Change-Your-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID"></a>Part 1: Reasons Why You Might Need To Change Your Apple ID</h2><p>Your iOS devices contain most of your digital data. That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.</p><p>If you feel the existing Apple ID isn’t secure enough, it’s a good idea to <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other devices. Aside from this, there are a few scenarios where you might find yourself needing to change your details:</p><p>You No Longer Use the Email Address or Phone Number Associated With Your Apple ID</p><p>Life moves fast, and sometimes contact info changes. If the email or phone number linked to your Apple ID becomes outdated, it’s a good idea to update it. That way, you won’t miss out on vital notifications or have trouble recovering your account if needed.</p><p>You Want To Simplify Your Online Life</p><p>If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.</p><p>You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country</p><p>Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-02.jpg"                      alt="apple id account information"                ></p><p>Changing your Apple ID can be smart, ensuring your digital life stays up-to-date, secure, and tailored to your needs.

Before you learn <strong>how to change the Apple ID on an iPad</strong> – for yourself or others, here are some common signs of a compromised Apple ID:</p><ul><li>A login attempt from a device or location that you don’t recognize</li><li>A password change that you didn’t know about</li><li>Unauthorized messages or purchases</li><li>A password that no longer works</li><li>Unfamiliar account details</li></ul><p>If you suspect unauthorized access to your Apple ID, below is what you can do.</p><p>Steps To Change Your Apple ID to a Different Email Address</p><p>If you are worried about losing data such as purchases and contacts, don’t worry. You can update your Apple ID account anytime without disrupting your data. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to change your Apple ID</strong> email address.

So, if you’re thinking of, “<strong>How can I change my Apple ID on my iPad</strong> if it’s a mobile phone number?” then this guide is for you:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log out of all Apple services and devices currently signed in with your Apple ID, except the one you’re using to change your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On your iPad, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>[your account name]</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign-in &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Edit</strong> next to <strong>Email &amp; Phone Numbers</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-06.jpg"                      alt="click edit on iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to the <strong>Delete</strong> icon next to your mobile number and follow the directions given.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter the code sent to the mobile number you added as your new Apple ID to verify it.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Log into all Apple services using your new Apple ID.</li></ul><p>Even if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to a mobile phone number, you can still associate it with a phone number on your account page.

If you’re trying to change your Apple ID to one that’s already in use, you’ll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn’t already taken. Remove it from the family member’s account if they are using it.</p><p>Your Apple ID Is an Email Address</p><p>If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won’t be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.</p><p>If you’ve addressed these issues and still can’t change your Apple ID, don’t worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges.

But have you encountered the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed-out</strong> dilemma, fixed at 30 seconds? When this setting becomes inaccessible, it limits your control over screen timeout.</p><p>Read on if you’ve encountered a similar problem on your iOS device. In this guide, we’ll explore the possible reasons and offer steps to fix <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPhone</strong> and iPad devices. If force restarts or settings resets haven’t worked for you, we’ve got alternative solutions. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 13 or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 13 or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 13 device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.
