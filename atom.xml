You may need to perform partition recovery when your hard drive partitions run into an error and don’t appear in File Explorer.</p><p><a href="#collapsethree">How does ‘Quick Scan’ differ from ‘Deep Scan’?</a></p><p> ‘Quick Scan’ helps you scan the selected drive faster. This mode is helpful in all data loss or deletion cases on Windows-based storage drives. Whereas ‘Deep Scan’ does a comprehensive, file signature-based search to maximize data recovery chances in tough data loss such as drive formatting, corruption, etc. Deep Scan is particularly useful when files couldn’t be found with ‘Quick Scan.’</p><p><a href="#collapsefour">Can I run Stellar Data Recovery Professional on a dual monitor setup?</a></p><p> You can run the software on a dual monitor setup and perform multiple tasks without switching or minimizing the screens. In addition, the feature helps perform complex data tasks such as recovering from corrupted or lost partitions with precision and ease.</p><p><a href="#collapsefive">Can I recover a specific file with the help of Stellar Data Recovery Professional software?</a></p><p> ‘Quick Scan’ performs a faster scan on your selected drive or volume. This mode of scan is used in almost all cases of data loss or deletion on Windows-based storage drive. Whereas ‘Deep Scan’ does a comprehensive file signature-based search to maximize recovery in tough cases of data loss such as drive formatting, corruption, etc. Deep Scan is particularly useful for recovering the files that couldn’t be found with ‘Quick Scan.’</p><p><a href="#collapsesix">Can I recover a specific file with the help of Stellar Data Recovery Professional software?</a></p><p> Yes. The software comes with an ‘Add File-Type’ feature that lets you add files even with a unique extension and perform data recovery. Besides this, you can run custom data recovery by choosing a particular type of data from the software’s ‘Select What to Recover’ screen.</p><p><a href="#collapseseven">Does Stellar Software recover data from optical drives?</a></p><p> The software can recover data from scratched, corrupted, or partially burnt optical media such as CDs, DVDs, HD DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. It also maintains the recovered files’ original file names and folder structure.</p><p><a href="#collapseeight">When to select the Physical Disk option?</a></p><p> When you cannot find your system (internal) or removable storage drive in File Explorer, or it appears Unallocated in Disk Management, the drive has turned RAW. You may use the ‘Physical Disk’ option to locate and recover data from RAW or inaccessible Physical or Removable Disks.</p><p>DATA RECOVERY IN-LAB SERVICES</p><h3

MOV is yet another popular file format, used by Apple devices. One of the most popular media players is QuickTime, which uses the MOV file format majorly used in Mac OS. However, there are many other media players, which support MOV files. In addition, there are devices like CCTV and HD cameras that capture the video in MOV file format.  </p><p> There are instances when such file formats fail to open or become inaccessible. It could be due to a software failure, or any interruption while transferring the file. In addition, there are various other reasons like the use of poor video editors or improper downloads that can make the MOV or any other video file corrupt. A corrupt or damaged MOV file fails to open in any media player including QuickTime. However, there are ways using which such issues can be fixed. The best way is to use professional software that is compatible with Mac OS.  </p><p> Stellar Repair for Video is an advanced Video repair software to repair corrupt or damaged video files from any storage media.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 8 Plus based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 8 Plus from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 8 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 8 Plus’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 8 Plus to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access.

These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

Get Answers here</h2><p>Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface.

It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, making it unusable.

While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access.

Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option.

They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and return the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="How-To-Fix-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Unavailable-Issue-With-Ease"><a href="#How-To-Fix-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Unavailable-Issue-With-Ease" class="headerlink" title="How To Fix Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Unavailable Issue With Ease"></a>How To Fix Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Unavailable Issue With Ease</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max stands out as an impressive device that integrates technology and practicality.

Get Answers here</h2><p>Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>. Let’s start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone devices back view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?"></a>Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?</h2><p>Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, it’s crucial to understand, “<strong>What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone</strong>?” While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts. Here’s how they differ:</p><ul><li><strong>Jailbreak</strong></li></ul><p><strong>If you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, what happens</strong> is you have root access to the iOS system. It opens customization and functionality beyond what is available.</p><ul><li><strong>iCloud Activation Lock</strong></li></ul><p>iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature that ties an Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the Apple ID used to set it up. If lost or stolen, it prevents unauthorized use even after a factory reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-04.jpg"                      alt="icloud activation lock on an iphone"                ></p><p>While jailbreaking grants you deeper access to the system, it can’t override or bypass the iCloud Activation Lock directly. However, third-party tools that can bypass iCloud activation lock use this access. These software, such as <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a>, leverage the jailbreak to access crucial system files and implement their bypass methods.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-3-Easily-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password"></a>Part 3: Easily Bypass iCloud Activation Lock Without Password</h2><p>Security risks? Warranty void? These are valid concerns when considering “<strong>What does it mean to jailbreak an iPhone</strong>?”</p><p>Not only that, but if you jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and face issues, you may need the Apple ID and password for access. Retrieving them is easy with known iCloud credentials. But reactivation becomes challenging if you’ve forgotten or bought a used iOS device without the previous owner’s details.</p><p>To solve this, you can use software to bypass the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Several tools in the market can do it, and Wondershare Dr.Fone is a standout option. It’s user-friendly, compatible with the latest iOS devices, and boasts an intuitive interface.</p><p>Here are some things Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool can offer:</p><ul><li>Can remove all types of locked screen</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/android-sim-unlock-code-generator.html"><u>Remove SIM lock</u></a>&#x2F; unlock iPhone carrier without losing data</li><li>Unlock Apple ID without a password</li><li><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>Bypass MDM without data loss</u></a></li><li>Remove iTunes backup encryption</li></ul><p>Dr.Fone uses the responsible path of jailbreaking your iOS device, giving you back control.

If an IMEI number is present, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device supports GSM networks. The findings indicate support for both GSM and CDMA networks.

That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

The first method is to try all the passwords you use on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. You can try finding the password from Keychain on macOS if this does not work. Another option is to “Reset All Settings” on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p><p>Lastly, Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock is a program that can help you bypass the passcode and get into your backups.

Get Answers here"></a>What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 11 i Do? Get Answers here</h2><p>Jailbreaking grants you root access to your smartphone, opening a range of features and functionalities. But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11 removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>. Let’s start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone devices back view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?"></a>Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?</h2><p>Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11, it’s crucial to understand, “<strong>What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone</strong>?” While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 11 based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 11 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 11’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 11, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts.

People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.</p><p>Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 13 Pro world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 13 Pro . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 13 Pro  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Bypass iPhone Lock Screen Apple iPhone 13 Pro  without Passcode [No iTunes]</strong></h2><p>The major difference between the lock screen and activation lock is that the lock screen can be bypassed without the password but, the user can never bypass the activation lock as it marks the security boundary of Apple.</p><p>You might be wondering how to escape the lock screen without a password because it is possible that you might forget the password, and now you can’t open your phone. Let’s look at how you can do this;</p><p>The commonly faced problem of many iOS users was that they forget the password but later, an amazing solution to this problem as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> application was known and used by almost all iOS users.

Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13 mini  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13 mini  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 13 mini device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 13 mini device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 13 mini device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 13 mini  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 13 .

Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 13  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 13 device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 13 device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 13 device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 13  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-13-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-13-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 12 mini world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 12 mini . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-12-mini-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-12-mini-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 12 mini  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 12 mini  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 12 mini device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 12 mini device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 12 mini device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 12 mini  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-12-mini-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-12-mini-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Note that if your iTunes is not synchronized with the iPhone, you risk losing your existing data. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your locked iPhone using a cable and let iTunes identify the Apple iPhone 12 mini device. Next, navigate to the <strong>Summary</strong> section and select the <strong>Restore iPhone</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-10.jpg"                      alt="itunes main window"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Allow iTunes to identify your device. Start the restoration of previous data by selecting <strong>Restore Backup</strong>. Your Apple iPhone 12 mini will be unlocked with all the associated data if you have backed up your information on iTunes. Otherwise, you will need to set it up as a new iPhone.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-3-Using-Recovery-Mode-To-Unlock-a-Locked-or-Disabled-iPhone"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Recovery-Mode-To-Unlock-a-Locked-or-Disabled-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Recovery Mode To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone"></a>Method 3: Using Recovery Mode To Unlock a Locked or Disabled iPhone</h3><p>Activating Recovery mode is another useful method for accessing a locked phone. The approach erases all data on the phone, restoring it to factory settings. Any data not backed up will be lost using this method. Follow the steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and Launch iTunes on your computer. Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini with a USB cable.</li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: For iPhone 8 models or newer, press and release the volume up button, followed by the volume down button. Next, press and hold the power button. If executed, the iTunes connect screen will appear. For earlier iPhone models, you can refer to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/iphone/iph8903c3ee6/15.0"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-11.jpg"                      alt="iphone hard reset"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> iTunes will prompt you to either restore or update your Apple iPhone 12 mini. Choose the <strong>Restore iPhone</strong> option to reset your device to its factory settings. If the restoration process extends beyond 15 minutes and your Apple iPhone 12 mini exits recovery mode, you’ll need to repeat the steps.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-4-Using-iCloud-To-Unlock-a-Lock-or-Disabled-iPhone"><a href="#Method-4-Using-iCloud-To-Unlock-a-Lock-or-Disabled-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone"></a>Method 4: Using iCloud To Unlock a Lock or Disabled iPhone</h3><p>After <strong>many failed passcode attempts on your Apple iPhone 12 mini</strong>，it got disabled, but iCloud offers a convenient solution. Your phone must have the Find My iPhone option enabled for the method to work. You should be aware of the Apple ID password associated with your iCloud account.

Here’s how.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to iCloud.com using another device, such as a computer, and log in with your Apple ID and password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-12.jpg"                      alt="icloud all devices"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select <strong>All Devices</strong>, and pick the locked iPhone from the dropdown menu.

It is the most straightforward method for opening your Apple iPhone 8 Plus, assuming you forgot your password.</p><p>Since iOS 15.2, Apple presented an “Erase iPhone” choice from the Security Lockout window. This window appears from the seventh time you enter an incorrect code. The steps beneath work if your Apple iPhone 8 Plus or iPad runs iOS 15.2 or later and has an internet connection:</p><ul><li>When you don’t know the lock screen PIN, please enter your password several times from your Lock Screen until it warns you the next time. Then do this step again until you see the Erase iPhone toward the side of the screen.</li><li>Tap Erase iPhone, then click again to affirm your action.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-passcode-without-computer-1.jpg"                      alt="erase iphone"                ></p><ul><li>Enter your Apple account credentials to sign out of your Apple ID on the phone.</li><li>Tap Erase iPhone back to erase all your files and settings forever.</li><li>Right when the phone restarts, comply with the on-screen steps. Yet again, set your phone, and restore your information and settings from a backup. Presently set another password for your phone.</li></ul><p><strong>Guidelines to Restore a Locked iPhone Running iOS 15.1 or Earlier:</strong></p><ul><li>Regardless, put your Apple iPhone 8 Plus into DFU mode.</li><li>Then, connect it to a PC or Mac through a Lightning USB.</li><li>Tap your Apple iPhone 8 Plus in the Finder sidebar on Macintosh or iTunes on the PC.</li><li>Pick Restore when you see the decision to Restore. Let the download finish, and your phone leaves the recovery mode screen. Yet again, then switch off your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and begin.</li><li>Disconnect your iDevice, then turn it on and set it up. That is all you must do.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-Find-My"><a href="#2-Use-Find-My" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Find My"></a>2. Use Find My</h3><p>Apple permits clients to erase iPhone data to protect it from others remotely. Nonetheless, your lock screen can save your data if you don’t erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device.

People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.</p><p>Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 14 Plus world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 14 Plus . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Plus  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Plus  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Plus  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The apps you had on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder"><a href="#Part-2-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iTunes-or-macOS-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iTunes or macOS Finder"></a>Part 2: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iTunes or macOS Finder</h2><p>Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to a Windows&#x2F; macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 14 Plus reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus is using the iCloud website to gain access back.

They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus and return the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 14 Plus is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 14 Plus easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 14 Plus again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="How-to-Remove-and-Reset-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#How-to-Remove-and-Reset-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove and Reset Face ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>How to Remove and Reset Face ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/daisy-raine/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/daisy-raine.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></a></p><p>Did you go wrong when you set the Face ID the first time?

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone 14 Plus in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.</p><p>Step 5: When done, tap Done.</p><p>In case you are getting the following error:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg"                      alt="face id error"                ></p><p>There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone 14 Plus 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone 14 Plus can be used solely with passcodes if you want.

People get attracted by anything that is new and unique. The competitive brands are taking things seriously and are coming up with the eye-catching mobile body and mesmerizing features.</p><p>Someone who is new in the Apple world must not be aware of the security activation lock and many other different features. No one can use your Apple device without the activation lock. The fact that user can remove all the data from iPhone whenever they want and can even restore it instantly gets user attention.</p><p>Looking more into the Apple iPhone 12 world, people might be confused between the lock screen and activation lock. Also, they might be facing the problem of how to bypass the lock screen of iPhone Apple iPhone 12 . Let us answer your questions and provide you some knowledge.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-12-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Someone-Bypass-the-Apple-iPhone-12-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 12  Activation Lock?"></a><strong>Part 1. Can Someone Bypass the Apple iPhone 12  Activation Lock?</strong></h2><p>Protecting user’s information is among the core objectives of Apple. For this purpose, an activation lock has been developed for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple Watch users. The lock prevents any other person from using your apple device in case it’s lost or stolen.</p><p>The phones that are iOS 7 or above versions do not need to manually enable the lock because it is auto-enabled once the phone is switched on. The strong security concerns behind this lock do not allow your device’s misuse from someone who is using it for the wrong purpose.</p><p>Apple’s activation server saves your Apple ID, and in case the phone is turned off, or any erasing activity is observed, then the Apple iPhone 12 device will ask to unlock the iCloud activation. Suppose you have purchased a phone from someone, and it asks for an activation lock. That is because the Apple iPhone 12 device is still linked with the old owner and hence, will not allow you to access the phone.</p><p>For this, if the Apple iPhone 12 device is asking for an activation lock, the user cannot bypass the Apple iPhone 12  activation lock. The only way to get rid of that is to break the link between the Apple device and the prior owner, but that requires Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-12-without-Passcode-No-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPhone-Lock-Screen-Apple-iPhone-12-without-Passcode-No-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Let’s look at how you can do this;</p><p>The commonly faced problem of many iOS users was that they forget the password but later, an amazing solution to this problem as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> application was known and used by almost all iOS users.

You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.</p><p>Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you’re getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Password Check</strong></li></ul><p>Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid Sharing an Apple ID</strong></li></ul><p>It’s best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></li></ul><p>If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It’s simple and highly effective.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Changing your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other iOS devices is a simple process that can help you protect your privacy and information. With the tips above, you can ensure your iOS data is safe and secure during the switch.</p><p>And if you need to remove your Apple ID without a password, Dr.Fone is a good option.
