Nonetheless, even the most cutting-edge devices experience occasional setbacks. Among these, one major problem for iPhone users is the “iPhone Unavailable” message. This problem typically arises when many incorrect passcode attempts have locked the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. It renders the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device inaccessible, displaying the “iPhone Unavailable” prompt.</p><p>Yet, worry not, for reliable methods exist to address this problem efficiently. In this guide, we’ll explore the best and proven techniques for <strong>how to fix iPhone unavailable</strong>. We will also walk you through step-by-step solutions and provide clear instructions to resolve your unavailable iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-fix-iphone-unavailable-issue-1.jpg"                      alt="fix iphone unavailable"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-iPhone-is-Unavailable-Explaining-the-Basics"><a href="#Part-1-iPhone-is-Unavailable-Explaining-the-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. iPhone is Unavailable: Explaining the Basics"></a>Part 1. iPhone is Unavailable: Explaining the Basics</h2><p>The “iPhone Unavailable” issue is a distressing fix encountered by users. It occurs when their <strong>iPhone becomes unavailable with a black screen</strong> and inaccessible due to many incorrect passcode attempts. This problem arises as a security measure implemented by Apple. Its primary aim is to protect the data on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and deter unauthorized access.</p><p>The iPhone’s security mechanism typically activates after six wrong attempts. It starts with making the Apple iPhone 14 Plus unavailable for a specific period. The device becomes permanently locked when the incorrect code is entered consecutively for the 10th time. This lock manifests as the “iPhone Unavailable” message on the screen.</p><p>This acts as a shield against potential intruders trying to gain access by guessing or brute-forcing the passcode. However, this protective measure can affect users who forget their passcodes or insert incorrect entries mistakenly. For example, there are cases of children playing with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, leading to accidental key presses. All of this makes learning <strong>how to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Plus unavailable</strong> an essential thing to learn.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-Fix-Unlock-iPhone-Unavailable-Without-Lossing-Data-By-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-Top-Fix-Unlock-iPhone-Unavailable-Without-Lossing-Data-By-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Then, smartphones changed everything, and Apple spearheaded that change with the Apple iPhone 12 mini and iPad.</p><p>The iPhone, despite screen size limitations, may be used as a personal computer all by itself, depending on users’ requirements. You can work on spreadsheets, documents, and presentations on the iPad, take notes, write, draw, play music, watch videos, and practically do everything a regular household would do on a computer.</p><p>So, in today’s time and age, it may be possible that some people work exclusively with their iPhones and iPads. In that case, how to unlock a disabled iPhone without a computer?</p><p>Worry not, because Apple’s Find My is your friend. You can use Find My on your other Apple device to erase and unlock the disabled iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Find My app on your iOS device or Mac. Note that the other device should be signed in with the same Apple ID as the disabled iPhone. If not, you may sign out of iCloud on the Apple iPhone 12 mini device and sign in using the other Apple ID (of the disabled iPhone).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-disabled-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="unlock disabled iphone with find my app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the disabled iPhone from the Apple iPhone 12 mini devices in the sidebar, click or tap the Apple iPhone 12 mini device on the map and click or tap Erase This Device.</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and restored to factory defaults. The setup will need to be performed again.</p><p>Now, as we know, if Find My does not show the disabled iPhone for any reason, you will necessarily have to gain access to a computer. The other option is to visit an Apple Store and get them to do the needful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135374/19272" target="_top" id="2135374">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135374" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135374/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-III-FAQs"><a href="#Part-III-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part III: FAQs"></a>Part III: FAQs</h2><p>Here are helpful frequently asked questions for you.</p><h3 id="FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled"><a href="#FAQ-1-What-is-iPhone-disabled" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?"></a>FAQ 1: What is iPhone disabled?</h3><p>iPhone is disabled most commonly when an incorrect password is entered too many times.</p><h3 id="FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss"><a href="#FAQ-2-Can-I-unlock-disabled-iPhone-without-data-loss" class="headerlink" title="FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?"></a>FAQ 2: Can I unlock disabled iPhone without data loss?</h3><p>Unlocking a disabled iPhone requires erasing the Apple iPhone 12 mini device.

And that means you will have to spend time setting it up again, restoring data from backup, and getting it back to the order you had previously. How about a tip to help you prevent a disabled iPhone?</p><p>A good passcode is one that you will remember, but it takes work for everyone to figure out. Again, this is for the safety and security of your data and device. You may use a 6-digit passcode or an alphanumeric passcode if that is more to your liking.</p><p>If you use Face ID, it will significantly minimize the instances you will have to enter your passcode, so make sure you do remember your passcode.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It has been nearly a decade since iPhones came with biometric authentication and around 5 years since they started using facial authentication. Both these technologies significantly reduced our dependence on having to key in our passcode each time we wanted to unlock the iPhone, buy an app, or perform an essential function.</p><p>But, when we attempt incorrect passcodes too many times, the Apple iPhone 12 mini gets disabled.

It enhances the Apple iPhone X device’s unlocking experience by automatically bypassing the lock screen. That is when certain conditions are met. Jailbreaking involves bypassing the software restrictions imposed by Apple. Here are the steps to <strong>iPhone 11 unlock screen without swiping</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by adding an external repository like Sileo or Cydia, which will serve as an emulator. Remember, it won’t be automatically added to your applications; you’ll need to do this manually. So, download the repository from the <a class="link"   href="https://www.sparkdev.me/" >SparkDev <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website (it’s not available on the App Store). Head to the “Tweaks” tab, find “AutoUnlockX,” and download it to your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Following this, go to “Sources” in your Apple iPhone X’s Settings, select “Edit,” and manually add the external repo to Cydia or Sileo. Open Sileo or Cydia and navigate to the “Search” page. In the search bar, type “AutoUnlockX.” Once the tweak appears, select it, and then tap “Get (Sileo)” or “Install (Cydia).”</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Confirm the selected repo by tapping the “Confirm” option and allow the tweak to install. Once installed, tap “Restart SpringBoard” to complete the download. After your Apple iPhone X resprings, proceed to enable AutoUnlockX.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Open Settings, tap on “App,” and then select “AutoUnlockX.” Toggle on “Enable Auto Unlock.” Customize other settings as desired by tapping on them to turn them on or off.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> When finished, tap the “Respring” option at the bottom to apply your changes. At last, unlock your Apple iPhone X using your Face ID effortlessly.</p><h3 id="Method-5-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-via-Voice-Control"><a href="#Method-5-Unlock-iPhone-Without-Swiping-Up-via-Voice-Control" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up via Voice Control"></a>Method 5: Unlock iPhone Without Swiping Up via Voice Control</h3><p>Utilizing Voice Control to unlock your Apple iPhone X offers a hands-free approach to accessing your device. It is especially helpful for individuals with accessibility needs. There are situations where manual interaction might be challenging. Here’s a guide on how to set up and use “Voice Control” to unlock your Apple iPhone X:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Open the Settings app on your Apple iPhone X and scroll down to tap “Accessibility.” On the following screen, press “Voice Control” to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-6.jpg"                      alt="navigate to voice control feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> To set up voice control, you need to ensure that the “Voice Control” option is toggled on.

You can follow these steps to bypass the Apple iPhone X passcode with Siri.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Firstly, hold the Home button on our phone to activate Siri. Speak a command like “Siri, what time is it?” to ask the present time.

If this happens, a hacker could access all your personal information. They could steal your photos, videos, contacts, and financial data.</p><p>They could also use your account to make unauthorized purchases or spread malware. That’s why knowing the signs of a hacked Apple ID password is crucial. If you notice any of the following, you should change your account password immediately:</p><ul><li><strong>Frequent Login Requests</strong></li></ul><p>If you notice unusual login attempts or receive notifications from Apple about new sign-ins from unknown devices or locations, it’s a red flag.

It indicates unauthorized access attempts.</p><ul><li><strong>Unusual Emails Sent from Your Account</strong></li></ul><p>Friends and family receiving strange emails from your Apple ID should raise suspicion.

Avoid using common words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as “123456” or “password.”</p><ul><li><strong>Length</strong></li></ul><p>Use a password at least 12 characters long, or even longer if possible.</p><p>Now that you have a solid foundation for creating a secure Apple ID password.

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone XS X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone XS and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone XS device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone XS 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone XS device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.</p><p>Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded “problem detected with TrueDepth camera” message on your Apple iPhone XS 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS 13 to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode.</p><p>Step 2: Scroll and tap the option “Reset Face ID” to remove Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-11.jpg"                      alt="wa stickers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Set-Up-Face-ID-on-Your-Apple-iPhone-XS" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone XS"></a>Part IV: How to Set Up Face ID on Your Apple iPhone XS</h2><p>Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your Apple iPhone XS 13 is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:</p><p>Step 1: Go to Settings &gt; Face ID and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.</p><p>Step 2: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.</p><p>Step 3: Hold your Apple iPhone XS in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-10.jpg"                      alt="setting up face id"                ></p><p>Step 4: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.</p><p>Step 5: When done, tap Done.</p><p>In case you are getting the following error:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-12.jpg"                      alt="face id error"                ></p><p>There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your Apple iPhone XS 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps. If you are running a beta version, you may downgrade back to the release version to see if that resolves the error. Betas can both make and break things.</p><p>If this does not resolve it, you need to take the Apple iPhone XS device to the nearest service center. The TrueDepth camera system has components that might have been damaged or might not be working properly, for whatever reason, and the service personnel is equipped to resolve this issue for you at the earliest.</p><h2 id="Part-V-The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#Part-V-The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Part V: The Bottom Line"></a>Part V: The Bottom Line</h2><p>Face ID is more than a nifty authentication system in iPhones (and iPads) and brings some unique features that are not found in previous Touch ID enabled devices and enable the users to interact with people (Animojis and Memojis) and with the Apple iPhone XS (user authentication via facial metrics, Attention Aware features) in new ways. There are times when this does not work as expected, and you can reset and remove Face ID if you feel this is not your cup of tea. Apple iPhone XS can be used solely with passcodes if you want. If you find that your screen is locked and you can‘t unlock it, you can always find help in tools such as Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone’s. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</p><ol><li>Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 12. You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.</li><li>Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13. Go to the iTunes menu, check for updates, and follow the simple on-screen instructions to update iTunes.</li></ol><p><strong>Step 1. Put your phone in the Recovery Mode</strong></p><p>After meeting the basic prerequisites, you need to put your Apple iPhone 12 in recovery mode by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Connect your Apple iPhone 12 to the system (Mac or Windows) and launch an updated version of iTunes on it.</li><li>Press the Volume Up key quickly. That is, press it only for a second and release it.</li><li>Similarly, quick-press the Volume Down key as well.</li><li>Once the Volume Down key is released, press the Side button.</li><li>Keep pressing the Side key until the connect-to-iTunes symbol would appear on the screen.</li></ol><p>Make sure that all the key combinations should be pressed consecutively. That is, you should not take an evident pause in between.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="put iphone xs in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.

Instead of turning off the Find my iPhone service, we will use it to erase the Apple iPhone 12 device remotely. Though, you should know your Apple ID and password to implement this technique.</p><ol><li>Go to iCloud’s official website and log in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li>From here, click on the “Find my iPhone” service.</li><li>It will provide a list of all the Apple iPhone 12 devices linked to your Apple account.

As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 12. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 12 that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 12 currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-12-X-Apple-iPhone-12-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-12-X-Apple-iPhone-12-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 12 X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 12 from being unlocked by thieves"></a>Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 12 X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 12 from being unlocked by thieves</h2><p>It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 12 from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 12 without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements. Out of all the provided options, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is recommended.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device. If you brought your device preowned and still have contact with the owner, they may have a passcode you can try.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool"><a href="#2-2-Unlock-iPhone-with-an-unlock-tool" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool"></a>2.2 Unlock iPhone with an unlock tool</h3><p>The second approach you can take if you don’t know the passcode and can’t get it unlocked is to use a powerful software solution known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage.

Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 8 and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 8 to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 8 in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work.

Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 8 device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 8 device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen.

Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 8 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 8 device in question. To restart your Apple iPhone 8 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the Apple iPhone 8 device off.

There are a few things you can do:</p><p>Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.</p><p>So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.</p><p>You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone.

Here’s What to Do"></a>Forgot Apple iPhone 14 Plus Backup Password? Here’s What to Do</h2><p>Forgetting your Apple iPhone 14 Plus backup password can be a real pain. Not only does it mean you can’t access your data, but it also means you can’t restore your phone if something goes wrong.</p><p>There are still chances that you could forget your Apple iPhone 14 Plus backup password. Fortunately, you have a chance to recover your password. So, if you’re having trouble remembering your Apple iPhone 14 Plus backup password, don’t despair. There are still ways to get it back!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-1.jpg"                      alt="forget backup password"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Overview-of-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 1: Overview of iPhone Backup Password</h2><p>The Apple iPhone 14 Plus is secured using a combination that is the backup password. Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="1.

This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-3.jpg"                      alt="use find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus to unlock iphone 13 without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the ‘Find My iPhone’ option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select the ‘All Devices’ option at the top of the screen and select your Apple iPhone 14 Plus from the list of devices.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Click the ‘Erase’ option to confirm your action.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.</p><h3 id="Unlock-it-with-iTunes"><a href="#Unlock-it-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Unlock it with iTunes"></a>Unlock it with iTunes</h3><p>Another way to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus without a passcode is by using iTunes.

Here’s how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to the computer and launch the iTunes application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press and hold down the ‘Volume’ and ‘Power’ buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode.

Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 14 Plus ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again.

They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone XR with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone XR or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone XR.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone XR and return the Apple iPhone XR device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone XR is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone XR with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone XR easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone XR again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone XR, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone XR disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone XR device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-ice-and-velocity-memorable-moments-from-the-winter-olympics-snowboard-race/"><u>[New] Ice & Velocity Memorable Moments From the Winter Olympics Snowboard Race</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-boosting-profitability-in-the-world-of-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Profitability in the World of Youtube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/4-routines-to-pause-windows-and-office-software-updates/"><u>4 Routines to Pause Windows & Office Software Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/complete-guide-for-apple-iphone-7-plus-lock-screen-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Complete Guide For Apple iPhone 7 Plus Lock Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-a-lost-realme-10t-5g-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track a Lost Realme 10T 5G for Free? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-resolve-your-apple-iphone-15-keeps-asking-for-outlook-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Resolve Your Apple iPhone 15 Keeps Asking for Outlook Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-does-jailbreaking-apple-iphone-15-plus-i-do-get-answers-here-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, What Does Jailbreaking Apple iPhone 15 Plus i Do?

Moreover, an additional way to unlock iPhone is to use Apple Watch to unlock iPhone 11, X, or earlier models.</p><p>Once you meet these requirements, you can easily unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus while wearing a mask and get further details by reading this article.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-Face-ID-with-a-Mask-on"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-Face-ID-with-a-Mask-on" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Unlock iPhone Face ID with a Mask on"></a>Part 1: How to Unlock iPhone Face ID with a Mask on</h2><p>Are you excited to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus while wearing a face mask?

It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the “iPhone Locked to Owner” scenario can be hard as the fault doesn’t lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website.

It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device will remain locked to the previous owner’s iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-Locked-to-Owner-Security"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-Locked-to-Owner-Security" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone SE (2022) Locked to Owner Security"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone SE (2022) Locked to Owner Security</h2><p>Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner’s security can be frustrating.
