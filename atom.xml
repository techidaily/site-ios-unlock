You’re prompted to update your payment method to continue enjoying the service, but you weren’t aware your card needed updating.</p><p> Or perhaps you want to add a payment method to your Apple ID, but it gets declined. What do you do in either situation? Below, we’ll list a few steps you can take when Apple declines your payment method.</p><h2 id="1-Check-Your-Payment-Information"><a href="#1-Check-Your-Payment-Information" class="headerlink" title="1.

If your billing details, such as your address or ZIP code, is incorrect, this can cause your payment method to be declined.</p><p> If your current payment method has expired, you must renew your credit card and update your payment information or add a new payment method.</p><p>To check your payment information on an iPhone or iPad:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings</strong> , then tap your<strong>Apple ID name</strong> at the top.</li><li>Tap on<strong>Payment &amp; Shipping</strong> , then under<strong>Payment Methods</strong> , select your credit card.</li><li>Check your card number, expiry date, CVV, and billing information.

There are a few things you can do:</p><p>Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.</p><p>So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.</p><p>You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus is unparalleled.

You should know that this is not an official fix and only works for limited iOS devices (iOS 8.0 to iOS 13). Ideally, it is considered a loophole in iOS, which can be exploited to fix a disabled phone. You can learn how to get in a locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus by implementing the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> To activate Siri, please long press your home button on the phone. Ask for the present time (by saying “Hey Siri, what time is it?”) and wait for its response. Now, tap on the clock icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491422339.jpg"                      alt="hey siri" title="hey siri"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the world clock interface, add another clock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491682149.jpg"                      alt="world clock" title="world clock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The interface will ask you to search for a location of your choice. Type anything on the search tab and select it to get various options. Tap on the “Select all” text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994491845337.jpg"                      alt="select all" title="select all"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> A few added options will be displayed.

From here, tap on the “Create new contact” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492596641.jpg"                      alt="create new contact" title="create new contact"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Instead of adding a contact, tap on the photo icon and select the “Choose Photo” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/07/14994492748614.jpg"                      alt="choose photo" title="choose photo"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10.</strong> This will open the photo library on your phone.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work.

What are your possibilities for <strong>iTunes unlock phone</strong> if you run over such circumstances and lose your password? Certainly, when this question springs up, you must not get terrified. We are here to direct you through the process of fixing this issue.</p><p>Losing a passcode is entirely normal and can happen to anyone. So, if you are also among the lot, we will elaborate <strong>on how to unlock iPhone with iTunes.</strong> After thorough research, our experts have laid out some essential unlocking methods for our readers. So, if you need to get things straight, read this detailed guide to go over your issue.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Was-My-iPhone-Disabled"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Was-My-iPhone-Disabled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Was My iPhone Disabled?"></a>Part 1: Why Was My iPhone Disabled?</h2><p>Using a lock screen passcode to secure your iDevice is an excellent way. However, it can become troublesome when you forget the key to your phone. Moreover, you may get stuck even if your screen breaks. On the other hand, someone may take your phone and type a few incorrect passcodes.</p><p>If your screen displays “iPhone disabled,” the most probable reason is an excess of wrong passcode attempts. However, this can sometimes occur without you understanding if the phone is in your pocket.</p><p>It would help if you erased your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to eliminate the lock and passcode, then re-sync it with iTunes. Then, you can restore your phone from an iCloud or an iTunes backup, but if you have never used a backup on your phone, your phone will have nothing. This guide illustrates <strong>how to unlock disabled iPhone with iTunes.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-with-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iPhone-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Unlock iPhone with iTunes"></a>Part 2: How to Unlock iPhone with iTunes</h2><p>At first, iTunes was only a media software used to play, download and see sound and video documents. Later in 2011, it became a valuable tool to support information and adjust it across numerous devices.</p><p>It added the ‘Restore’ option that can assist clients with unlocking their iPhones when they forget their passcode.</p><p>In any case, one has to know that iTunes is not an expert unlocking tool. Apple seldom updates iTunes, and its last update was long ago. Consequently, it has numerous tech bugs. As a result, the unlocking process using iTunes takes a lot of time. During the process, you may experience different error codes like 3004, 1100, 3194, 4000, and 4013. That makes it a tedious process.</p><p><strong>Requirements for Windows PC:</strong></p><ul><li>For <strong>iTunes unlock phone</strong>, your PC should have installed Windows 8 or later and the most recent iTunes variant.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements for Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Open the Finder window if you have macOS Catalina or a more recent one.</li><li>Open the most current version of iTunes using macOS Mojave or older.</li><li>You must have a USB connector.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps (For Windows)</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1.

Open iTunes on Windows PC.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Put your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in recovery mode</strong></p><p>To enter a Recovery Mode, press a combination of buttons on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Doing such, you will see a recovery mode screen on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. To place the Apple iPhone 6 Plus in Recovery mode, follow these:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone 8 or above (second and third generation):</strong> Press and release the volume (+) button. Press and release the volume (-) button. Hold power&#x2F;side button until seeing the recovery mode on your screen.</li><li><strong>iPhone 7 and 7 Plus:</strong> Press the top (or side) and volume down buttons simultaneously until the recovery screen shows up.</li><li><strong>iPhone SE (first generation) and iPhone 6S:</strong> Hold the home button and the power&#x2F;side button simultaneously until the recovery mode screen shows up.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you see the passcode screen, switch off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and do the process again until you see the Recovery mode screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Restore your Apple iPhone 6 Plus</strong></p><p>As the recovery Mode screen shows up on the iPhone, you will find your Apple iPhone 6 Plus on <strong>iTunes unlock phone</strong> screen.

So, click on Restore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-with-itunes-1.jpg"                      alt="click restore"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> It then asks you to confirm whether you are sure you need to restore the Apple iPhone 6 Plus to its default factory state.

Passwords, Wi-Fi settings, browser history, and health records are sensitive information that an encrypted device may back up.</p><p>Remember that this is not the same as your Apple ID or passcode (the sequence you input to unlock the iPhone).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>The encryption of backups is not turned on by default. You will only need to activate the Encrypt Backup option the first time you use either iTunes or Finder. After that, each of your backups will encrypt on its own automatically.</p><p>So, if you choose to store your backups in iCloud, it will automatically encrypt all of your data each and every time.</p><p><strong>To get the password for the encrypted backup of iTunes:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open iTunes</p><p>Launching iTunes is the first thing to do if you have a Mac computer running Mojave 10.14 or an older operating system version. On the other hand, if you use the Mac operating system known as Catalina 10.15, you need to run the Finder application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Link your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to your PC</p><p>At this point, a USB cable should be used to connect the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to a computer. The next step is to find the widget on your desktop computer or portable device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the Encryption Process</p><p>Select the Encrypt Local Backup option in the Backups section directly from either the Summary or General tab of the Backups section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/forgot-iphone-backup-password-2.jpg"                      alt="encryption"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Create a Password</p><p>When prompted in the window, create a password for the account. Make it powerful yet that is simple for you to remember. You might also save it somewhere secure to help you recall it later.</p><p>After establishing the password, all your previous backups will immediately undergo an automated overwrite and encryption. Make it a priority to ensure that the encryption procedure is finished effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password"><a href="#Part-2-5-Fixes-When-We-Forgot-iPhone-Backup-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password"></a>Part 2: 5 Fixes When We Forgot iPhone Backup Password</h2><h3 id="1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus"><a href="#1-Try-all-passwords-you-used-on-your-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus" class="headerlink" title="1.

There are a few things you can do:</p><p>Setting a passcode for your birthday can be tempting. It could also be an ATM PIN. However, you should avoid that temptation because if someone knows one of them, they know the other by default.</p><p>So how to use a memorable yet indecipherable passcode? The best strategy is to mix and match. For example, use two digits of something, two of another, and two of another to create six digits of the passcode. That will maintain the ease for you to remember the passcode but make it difficult for someone else to figure out that specific combination.</p><p>You can also use the alphanumeric passcode feature on the iPhone. However, we recommend changing the passcode frequently for extra security.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The convenience of Touch ID on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus is unparalleled.

Usually, “<strong>Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to use accessories</strong>“ will appear on the screen. In most cases, enter the passcode to unlock the phone, and you can then proceed with data transfer and management. What to do if you forget your screen lock passcode? Here come the most effective methods for you!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-You-Need-to-“Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-Use-Accessories”"><a href="#Part-1-Why-You-Need-to-“Unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-Use-Accessories”" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why You Need to “Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Use Accessories”?"></a>Part 1: Why You Need to “Unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Use Accessories”?</h2><p>The command comes from Apple’s significant privacy safeguard <strong>“USB Restricted Mode”</strong>. It means after an hour of your iOS device is unlocked, the system cuts off the lightning port and limits it to charging only. Simply put, when your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is locked for more than an hour, it needs to be unlocked to allow the connection of USB accessories. Sometimes, when you unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus screen to use USB accessories, it can’t charge anymore.</p><p>In 2017, a password cracking tool called GrayKey was launched, which can bypass any iPhone screen lock passcode. The FBI, the police, and some government agencies have all become GrayKey customers. To combat hackers including GrayKey and protect iOS users’ data security, the USB Restricted Mode feature arrived with iOS 11.4.1 in July 2018 and be improved in iOS12.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Disable-USB-Restricted-Mode"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Disable-USB-Restricted-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Disable USB Restricted Mode?"></a>Part 2: How to Disable USB Restricted Mode?</h2><p>If you find this warning annoying or your Apple iPhone 6 Plus not charging when using USB accessories, disabling USB Restricted Mode is an optional solution.

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it. You will have wiped and unlocked your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and it will start with factory settings. Note that this works only if the Apple iPhone 6 Plus was connected to Find My in the first place. If not, then you always have Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to help you out.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#II-III-Put-The-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="II.III Put The Apple iPhone 6 Plus in Recovery Mode"></a>II.III Put The Apple iPhone 6 Plus in Recovery Mode</h3><p>You can unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus using Recovery Mode, yourself.</p><p>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to the computer and open iTunes.

From all the provided lists of the connected devices, remove your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to disable the Find my iPhone service.</p><p>Follow these steps to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a passcode.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iOS device to the system</strong></p><p>Download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) on your Mac or Windows PC and launch the application. Then go to Toolbox &gt; Screen Unlock &gt; iOS &gt; Unlock iOS Screen to launch the specific tool on a new window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-1.png"                      alt="unlock ios screen"                ></p><p>Using a lightning cable, connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to the system. Once your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is detected, click on the “Start” button to commence the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-2.png"                      alt="connect iphone to computer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Put your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in Recovery mode.</strong></p><p>You need to put your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in the Recovery mode using the right key combinations. The key combinations would be different for various iPhone models. The interface also provides quick instructions to do the same. Here’s how you can put your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in Recovery mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="download iPhone firmware"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Provide basic details of your device</strong></p><p>As soon as your Apple iPhone 6 Plus would enter the Recovery mode, the application will detect it automatically. It will display the following window to provide basic details related to your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, like its model, iOS version, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="download iPhone firmware"                ></p><p>After proving the relevant information, click on the “Download” button and wait for a while as the application would download the firmware update for the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Unlock your device.</strong></p><p>Once the respective firmware update has been downloaded, you will be notified.

There won’t be any lock on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device now, and you can access it without any trouble.</p><p>In this way, you can learn how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/solutions/iphone-lock-screen-password-forgot.html" >unlock iPhone without a passcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Face ID. Though, you should know that the existing data on your phone would be erased. Sadly, there is no solution to unlock an iOS device without deleting its existing data. Therefore, this is a risk you need to take if you wish to unlock your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-with-iTunes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-with-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus with iTunes?"></a>Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus with iTunes?</h2><p>Just like Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS), you can also use iTunes to fix the Apple iPhone 6 Plus won’t unlock the problem. Though, the solution is not as user-friendly or effective as Dr.Fone’s. You need to take care of some prerequisites before following this technique. Also, to unlock your device with iTunes, you need to put your phone in recovery mode. The key combination would slightly vary among different iPhone models.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</p><ol><li>Just like Dr.Fone, this technique will only work if the Find My iPhone service is not enabled on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. You can go to iCloud’s website and disable the feature under the “Find my iPhone” option.</li><li>Also, you need an updated version of iTunes to make it work. This is because an older version of iTunes won’t be compatible with iOS 13. Go to the iTunes menu, check for updates, and follow the simple on-screen instructions to update iTunes.</li></ol><p><strong>Step 1. Put your phone in the Recovery Mode</strong></p><p>After meeting the basic prerequisites, you need to put your Apple iPhone 6 Plus in recovery mode by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to the system (Mac or Windows) and launch an updated version of iTunes on it.</li><li>Press the Volume Up key quickly. That is, press it only for a second and release it.</li><li>Similarly, quick-press the Volume Down key as well.</li><li>Once the Volume Down key is released, press the Side button.</li><li>Keep pressing the Side key until the connect-to-iTunes symbol would appear on the screen.</li></ol><p>Make sure that all the key combinations should be pressed consecutively. That is, you should not take an evident pause in between.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-1.jpg"                      alt="put iphone xs in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Restore Apple iPhone 6 Plus in Recovery Mode</strong></p><p>As soon as your phone would enter the recovery mode, iTunes will detect an issue with your device and display the following prompt. Click on the “Restore” option and follow the simple on-screen instructions to reset your phone entirely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs in recovery mode"                ></p><p>Once your phone would be restored, it will be turned on without any existing lock.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-without-a-passcode-using-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-without-a-passcode-using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a passcode using iCloud?"></a>Part 3: How to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a passcode using iCloud?</h2><p>Another way to learn how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus without a passcode or Face ID is by using iCloud. Instead of turning off the Find my iPhone service, we will use it to erase the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device remotely. Though, you should know your Apple ID and password to implement this technique.</p><ol><li>Go to iCloud’s official website and log in with your Apple ID and password.</li><li>From here, click on the “Find my iPhone” service.</li><li>It will provide a list of all the Apple iPhone 6 Plus devices linked to your Apple account. Select your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</li><li>Click on the “Erase” button and answer the security question correctly to confirm your choice.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-3.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode in icloud"                ></p><p>If you get a prompt on your phone regarding the respective actions, agree to it and wait for a while as your phone would be restarted. Since this will erase all the existing data on your phone, you can later use a backup file to restore the lost content.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Does-the-tricking-Siri-method-unlocks-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus"><a href="#Part-4-Does-the-tricking-Siri-method-unlocks-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone 6 Plus?"></a>Part 4: Does the tricking Siri method unlocks Apple iPhone 6 Plus?</h2><p>Lately, there have been a lot of articles about this method. As an expert, I would like to clear the air – you can’t trick Siri to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. In some iPhone models, we could trick Siri into unlocking our device and entering the home page without bypassing the lock screen. The trick worked for a few devices and was an instant hit as it retained our data while unlocking our device.</p><p>It was a loophole from Apple’s end, which was present in iOS 10.3. Therefore, if your device is still running on iOS 10.3, then you might give it a try. Sadly, the only way to bypass an Apple iPhone 6 Plus that won’t unlock now is the restore your device (erasing its existing content). Since Apple iPhone 6 Plus currently runs on iOS 14, the trick won’t work.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-X-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-protecting-your-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-X-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-from-being-unlocked-by-thieves" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 6 Plus X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 6 Plus from being unlocked by thieves"></a>Part 5: Tips for protecting your Apple iPhone 6 Plus X&#x2F;Apple iPhone 6 Plus from being unlocked by thieves</h2><p>It would help if you always protected your Apple iPhone 6 Plus from being misused by others. If your device is lost or stolen, you should make sure that the perpetrator won’t be able to unlock it. If they can bypass the security lock on your phone, then they can easily resell it. To protect your device, we recommend following these suggestions.</p><p><strong>5.1 Enable Find my iPhone</strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do to protect your phone from being misused. As you can see, a perpetrator can only unlock your device if the Find my iPhone service is turned off. Therefore, you should make sure that the feature is on. To turn it off, they would need to access your iCloud account first, which would require a lot of effort.</p><p>Just go to the iCloud settings on your phone and turn on the “Find my iPhone” service. Also, enable the “Send Last Location” feature. This will automatically send the last location of your device whenever its battery would be critically low.</p><p><strong>5.2 Use Find my Friends</strong></p><p>Just like Find my iPhone, Find my Friends is a native location-sharing feature developed by Apple. You should have at least 2-3 people with whom you are sharing your location. Go to the Find my Friends app on your device, enable the location sharing feature, and add your close friend and family.</p><p>In this way, if your device is stolen, you can track it immediately with the help of your friends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-6.jpeg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p><strong>5.3 Enable two-factor authentication</strong></p><p>Your iCloud account should be protected at any cost. By infiltrating your iCloud account, anyone can erase your phone remotely. It is recommended to enable the two-factor authentication on your account to strengthen its security. Go to your device’s Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Passcode &amp; Security and enable the two-factor authentication feature.</p><p><strong>5.4 Erase data after failed unlocking attempts</strong></p><p>This is a crucial setting that you should enable to protect your data from unknown perpetrators. If someone tried to unlock your device and get 10 failed attempts, your data would automatically be erased from your phone.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and turn on the “Erase Data” option. Though, if you have enabled the option and have forgotten the passcode of your phone, then you should be alarmed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/unlock-iphone-x-without-passcode-8.jpg"                      alt="unlock iphone xs without passcode"                ></p><p>When you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus without the passcode, you can easily fulfill your requirements. Out of all the provided options, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is recommended.

If not, press the Power button and slide the screen to turn your Apple iPhone 6 Plus off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060132012488.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus passcode without itunes-put Apple iPhone 6 Plus in recovery mode"                ></p><p>2. Now, launch iTunes on your Mac or Windows system. Afterward, press and hold the Home button on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. While holding the Home button, connect it to your system.</p><p>3. You will get an iTunes symbol on the screen. In no time, iTunes will also detect your device.</p><p>4. As iTunes will detect your device in recovery mode, it will display a prompt similar to this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060132381393.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus passcode without itunes-restore Apple iPhone 6 Plus to remove the lock screen"                ></p><p>5.

This is because, as of now, there is no way to unlock an iPhone without restoring it. Needless to say, while restoring a device, its data is automatically lost. Since Apple is quite concerned about the security of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and the sensitivity of its data, it doesn’t let users unlock the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device without losing their data.</p><p>Even though lots of users have complained about this issue, Apple hasn’t come up with a solution yet. The best way to avoid this scenario is by taking a regular backup of your data. You can either backup your data on iCloud, via iTunes, or by using any third-party tool as well. In this way, you won’t be able to lose your important files while unlocking your device’s passcode.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now when you know how to unlock Apple iPhone 6 Plus passcode without iTunes, you can easily access your device.

The chances of it happening are notoriously higher when you just started using it. We are talking of passcodes on iPhones. Apple requires setting up a 6-digit passcode to use some features such as Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. So, you thought it was a great idea to set up your new Apple iPhone 6 Plus with a new passcode, right? The only problem is that the 6 digits you thought are bulletproof and no one will be able to come up with them in relation to you, are not coming to you either. You forgot the newly set passcode, entered the incorrect passcode more times than the software was happy about, and the Apple iPhone 6 Plus is locked now. What to do? Read on.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Locked"><a href="#Part-I-Why-Is-Your-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Locked?"></a>Part I: Why Is Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Locked?</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is locked, the primary ones being that you bought a second-hand Apple iPhone 6 Plus from someone who set it up with a passcode and decided it wasn’t for them and was nonchalant enough to sell it to you without removing the passcode from the Apple iPhone 6 Plus, or that you forgot the passcode to your new Apple iPhone 6 Plus and entered it incorrectly a few times. In any case, help is at hand.</p><p>We understand how frustrating it can be when your newly purchased Apple iPhone 6 Plus does not unlock because of a passcode entry issue, and all you want to do is get the screen unlocked. At Wondershare, we strive to create meaningful differences in the lives of the people that use our software and keeping that in mind, we have a solution for you to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus passcode screen using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).</p><h3 id="II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus"><a href="#II-I-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS-to-Unlock-the-Locked-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus" class="headerlink" title="II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus"></a>II.I Using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) to Unlock the Locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus</h3><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Simple, click-through, process.</li><li>Unlock screen passwords from all iPhone and iPad.</li><li>No tech knowledge is required, everybody can handle it.</li><li>Supports iPhone XS (Max) &#x2F; iPhone XR &#x2F; iPhone X &#x2F; 8 (Plus)&#x2F; iPhone 7(Plus)&#x2F; iPhone6s(Plus), iPhone SE and the latest iOS version fully!<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>4,395,217</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Dr.Fone is a set of modules that make life easy for you.

So, if you have forgotten the passcode and are unable to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, there is a way you can unlock it using Find My. Doing this will wipe your data from the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device and set it up as new, though. Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it.

However, this may be easier said than done. Fortunately, today we’re going to go through multiple solutions to help you get your device working as it should!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly"><a href="#Part-1-Don’t-try-passcodes-blindly" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly"></a>Part 1. Don’t try passcodes blindly</h2><p>One of the worst things you can do when faced with this situation is to enter passcodes blindly. Perhaps you’re trying random numbers and letters, or you’re trying passwords you’ve used in the past. If you get it wrong, you’re going to be locked out of your device for a long time.</p><p>The more times you get your code wrong, the longer you’ll be locked out, so avoid doing this at all costs, so make sure you move straight onto these approaches to get your phone working as quickly as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update"><a href="#Part-2-5-ways-to-unlock-iPhone-after-iOS-17-14-Update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update"></a>Part 2. 5 ways to unlock iPhone after iOS 17&#x2F;14 Update</h2><h3 id="2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family"><a href="#2-1-Try-a-default-passcode-in-your-family" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Try a default passcode in your family"></a>2.1 Try a default passcode in your family</h3><p>While we said, you shouldn’t type in random numbers to try and guess the password, of course, if you have a standard family passcode that you use across all iOS devices, perhaps an admin password or just something you use for everything, it can be well worth a try.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/iphone-random-passcodes-.jpg"                      alt="iphone random passcodes"                ></p><p>In reality, you get three attempts to put a passcode in before it locks you out, so try two passcodes that your family uses to see whether this will easily unlock your device.

If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode.

You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option.

This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device.

This built-in feature of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus allows you to turn your device to its factory settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/i-found-an-iphone-how-do-i-unlock-it-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock found iphone in recovery mode with itunes"                ></p><p>But there are two ways to unlock a found iPhone from recovery mode. The old iPhones, like iPhone 5 to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, can be unlocked from recovery mode differently, and the newer iPhone models have different methods.</p><p>So, let’s discuss both of them in detail.</p><p><strong>Unlock iPhone 7 Plus and Older in Recovery Mode</strong></p><p>If you want to unlock an iPhone 7 or older model in Recovery Mode, follow these instructions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/i-found-an-iphone-how-do-i-unlock-it-3.jpg"                      alt="put iphone 7 plus or older in recovery mode"                ></p><ol><li>First, connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to the computer with a lightning cable and launch iTunes.</li><li>Now, turn off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and then press and hold the Home button and Sleep&#x2F;Wake button simultaneously.

Once the process is completed, your Apple iPhone 6 Plus will be unlocked.</li></ol><p>Now, set up your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, and you are good to go.</p><p><strong>Unlock iPhone 8 and Update Models in Recovery Mode</strong></p><p>The process of unlocking an iPhone 8 or newer model differs from the older models. So, follow these instructions if you want to unlock an iPhone 8 or later in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/i-found-an-iphone-how-do-i-unlock-it-4.jpg"                      alt="put iphone 8 and newer iphones in recovery mode"                ></p><ol><li>First, connect your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to the computer with a lightning cable and launch iTunes.</li><li>Now, turn off your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and press and quickly release the Volume Up button.

In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 6 Plus based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 6 Plus from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 6 Plus:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 6 Plus’s performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates.

Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-01.jpg"                      alt="auto lock greyed out on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Auto-Lock-Greyed-Out-on-iOS-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is Auto-Lock Greyed Out on iOS Device?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why the Auto-Lock might be greyed out on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad device, preventing you from adjusting the duration. Here are the most common culprits:</p><p>Low Power Mode</p><p>When you activate Low Power Mode on your iOS device, you might notice the screen automatically locking after 30 seconds of inactivity. This quick sleep setting, implemented to minimize power usage, explains why the Auto-Lock option appears greyed out and inaccessible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-02.jpg"                      alt="low power mode on iphone enabled"                ></p><p>Screen Time Restrictions</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-turn-off-screen-time-without-passcode.html"><u>Screen Time restrictions</u></a> can impact Auto-Lock. For instance, if your downtime schedule blocks all apps, the screen locks itself, even if the Auto-Lock timer hasn’t run out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-03.jpg"                      alt="screen time settings on iphone"                ></p><p>MDM Profile Restrictions</p><p>If the Auto-Lock is greyed out on your iPad or iPhone and you use it for work or school, a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile might be the reason. This profile restricts settings, including Auto-Lock. To fix this, contact your IT administrator and ask if they can <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mdm-bypass-free.html"><u>adjust the MDM profile settings</u></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-04.jpg"                      alt="setup remote management on iphone"                ></p><p>Alright, you know the possible reasons why the Auto-Lock option is not working on your iOS device. Still, you might be wondering how to fix the Auto-Lock greyed-out issue. Below are several ways to get your iPad or iPhone Auto-Lock working normally again.</p><p>Fix No.1: Disable Low Power Mode</p><p>Your <strong>iPhone Auto-Lock greyed out</strong> because Low Power Mode limits background activities, including the Auto-Lock option. In this mode, you cannot change the Auto-Lock settings. Turn off Low Power Mode to fix this issue and choose your preferred timeout. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad’s <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and tap <strong>Battery</strong>. It will show you your device’s battery usage and available settings.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>. Now, the greyed-out Auto-Lock option in Settings should be available again.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-05.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off low power mode"                ></p><p>Low Battery Mode can stretch your battery life further. But if you need your screen to stay on longer, like while reading an article or watching a video, you can turn it off. It lets you adjust the screen timeout in <strong><strong>Settings</strong></strong> so it stays awake for as long as you like.</p><p>Fix No.2: Check Screen Time Restrictions</p><p>You’ve ruled out the Low Power Mode, but the <strong>Auto-Lock greyed out on iPad</strong> or iPhone remains. If Low Power Mode isn’t causing the problem, your screen time settings might be the issue. Some app restrictions can limit your screen use to specific times, causing it to lock automatically. Resolve this by removing limits, such as downtime and app restrictions, or turning it off.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Screen Time,</strong> then scroll down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Turn Off Screen Time</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off screen time on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.3: Remove MDM Configuration Profile</p><p>A configuration profile is a file that contains settings and restrictions that can be applied to an iOS device. Organizations, schools, or IT administrators often use it to manage devices remotely and enforce specific configurations. Once installed, the settings within a profile override the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device’s default settings. It can include restrictions related to security, network access, app usage, and more.</p><p>Since an MDM configuration profile causes limitations, like the greyed-out <strong><strong>Auto-Lock on iPad</strong></strong>, removing it can be the solution. Doing so frees your iOS device from external settings imposed by the profile. Then, it could allow you to adjust the Auto-Lock time setting as you normally would.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> See the configuration profiles you installed on your iOS device.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p></li><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profiles &amp; Device Management</strong> on your iPad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the configuration profile you need to delete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove Profile</strong>, enter your device passcode, then tap <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-07.jpg"                      alt="remove configuration profile on iphone"                ></p><p>Fix No.4: Remove Network Settings Installed by MDM</p><p>Businesses often use Mobile Device Management (MDM) to remotely manage their employees’ iPhones and iPads. MDM lets IT admins push software updates, restrict apps, and remotely wipe a lost device. This keeps corporate data safe and devices under control, whether the company or the employee owns them.</p><p>If you’re having trouble with a greyed-out Auto-Lock timeout setting, disassociating your device from MDM might be an option. But remember, this is a big step. Make sure you follow your company’s authorized procedures to avoid unintended consequences.</p><p>If your IT team gives the green light, you might also be able to remove the network settings installed by MDM. Just proceed with caution, as messing with these settings could lead to instability or data loss. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile</strong> or <strong>VPN &amp; Device Management</strong> (or a similar section).</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the management and tap <strong>Remove Management</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/auto-lock-greyed-out-08.jpg"                      alt="remove mdm profile on ipad"                ></p><p>If the option is unavailable, only the person who used Apple Configurator 2 or handles your company’s mobile device management platform can remove it.</p><p>Fix No.5: Use Dr.Fone To Bypass MDM Lock Without Data Loss</p><p>Unfortunately, manually removing profiles can be tricky, especially if they’re associated with MDM, Apple School Manager, or supervised configurations. These often require the removal of passwords, admin privileges, or complete data wipes. But there’s good news. <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock (iOS) provides a simpler and safer solution.</p><p>Here’s why you should try it:</p><ul><li>**Speedy and Efficient:**No more endless troubleshooting.

Or are you tired to put off the mask to use Face ID to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus? And now, you want to disable the Face ID. Whatever your reasons are, read this article to learn <strong>how to remove Face ID</strong> on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus X, iPhone XS, iPhone XR or iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, anmd iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-I-What-is-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-I-What-is-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: What is Face ID?"></a>Part I: What is Face ID?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><p>If the new Apple iPhone 6 Plus is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your Apple iPhone 6 Plus from the 6&#x2F;7&#x2F;8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.</p><p>Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 14, and now the Apple iPhone 6 Plus 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.</p><p>Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.</p><h2 id="Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID"><a href="#Part-II-What-Can-You-Do-with-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?"></a>Part II: What Can You Do with Face ID?</h2><p>Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode.

Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and added Memojis alongside Animojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="animojis and memojis"                ></p><p>Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.</p><p>Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11:</p><p>Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.</p><p>Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji&#x2F; Memoji you want to send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="recording a memoji"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap the Record button and you now have 30 seconds to do what you want with your face and the character will reproduce it on screen for you.</p><p>Step 4: When done, the Record button changes to Send:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/remove-face-id-on-iphone-13-9.jpg"                      alt="sending a memoji"                ></p><p>Tap Send to send your first Memoji&#x2F; Animoji.</p><h2 id="Part-III-How-to-Remove-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus"><a href="#Part-III-How-to-Remove-Face-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 6 Plus"></a>Part III: How to Remove Face ID on Apple iPhone 6 Plus</h2><p>For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.</p><p>Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus 13&#x2F;12&#x2F;11 and set it again if you have put on some ‘COVID weight’ owing to working from home.</p><p>Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device in question.

Knowing <strong>how many attempts to unlock an iPhone</strong> is vital due to Apple’s security measures. Exceeding the limit triggers consequences, such as temporary disablement or even data erasure.</p><p>These restrictions highlight the need to learn <strong>how many attempts for iPhone passcodes</strong> are allowed before facing potential data loss. When dealing with failed passcode attempts, exploring methods for successful access is essential. Let’s delve into the intricacies of iPhone passcode security and unveil strategies for a seamless unlocking process. Read on to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone unavailable notification after many attempts"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Many-Times-Until-the-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Is-Permanently-Disabled"><a href="#Part-1-How-Many-Times-Until-the-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Is-Permanently-Disabled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How Many Times Until the Apple iPhone 6 Plus Is Permanently Disabled?</h2><p>Unlocking an iPhone involves a series of attempts, each with distinct consequences. Here’s a breakdown of <strong>how many failed passcode attempts on an iPhone</strong> you can do before it locks you out:</p><p><strong>First 5 Attempts</strong></p><ul><li>No significant consequences.</li><li>Users have the flexibility to enter their passcode without any penalties.</li></ul><p><strong>6th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>iPhone is disabled for 1 minute.</li><li>An iPhone is Disabled message appears on the screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone is disabled 1 minute"                ></p><p><strong>7th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>Disabled for 5 minutes.</li><li>The same on-screen message persists, but the Apple iPhone 6 Plus enforces a longer wait time.</li></ul><p><strong>8th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>Disabled for 15 minutes.</li><li>Users must wait before attempting again. The escalating time delay discourages brute-force attacks.</li></ul><p><strong>9th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>Disabled for 60 minutes.</li><li>A considerable waiting period is imposed. It increases the frustration for unauthorized users attempting to gain access.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone is disabled 1 hour"                ></p><p><strong>10th Attempt</strong></p><ul><li>iPhone is disabled.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/attempts-to-unlock-iphone-04.jpg"                      alt="iphone is disabled connect to itunes"                ></p><p>Two things can happen on the tenth failed attempt to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. If you have <strong>Erase Data</strong> enabled, your phone’s data gets wiped. If it’s disabled, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus is permanently locked, requiring a connection to iTunes for restoration. It’s crucial to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html"><u>back up your data on iCloud</u></a> or locally to avoid permanent loss.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Consequences-After-Consecutive-Failed-Attempts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Consequences-After-Consecutive-Failed-Attempts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Are the Consequences After Consecutive Failed Attempts?</h2><p>When you exceed ten unsuccessful passcode entries, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device takes stringent actions to protect sensitive data. It can initiate a data wipe or lock the iPhone, needing a connection to iTunes for restoration. After a series of failed attempts, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus can activate a security measure often referred to as a “self-destruct” mode.</p><p>To turn this mode on or off, follow these steps:</p><h3 id="How-To-Enable-Erase-Data-Mode"><a href="#How-To-Enable-Erase-Data-Mode" class="headerlink" title="How To Enable Erase Data Mode"></a>How To Enable Erase Data Mode</h3><p>Safeguard your personal information with these simple steps to remotely wipe your device in case of loss or theft.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Face ID &amp; Passcode</strong> or <strong>Touch ID &amp; Passcode</strong>, depending on your device.

If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.</p><p>Step 2: Pick your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and do the following:</p><p>(2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.</p><p>(2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.</p><p>(2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone to factory settings"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>When the Apple iPhone 6 Plus reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Using-iCloud-Website-Find-iPhone-method" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)"></a>Part 3: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Using iCloud Website (Find iPhone method)</h2><p>Another method you may go with to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus is using the iCloud website to gain access back. This is a fairly easy way and doesn’t require going through complex hoops.</p><p>Find My is available both online via the iCloud website and on iOS devices and on Macs. In case the only Apple product you own is the currently disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus, you can use Find My on the iCloud website from any other computer you may have to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>Step 1: Visit <em><a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> and log in into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Find My, select your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="icloud find my iphone"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p>This will start the wipe process on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus remotely and your Apple iPhone 6 Plus will be reset to factory settings. You can now proceed to setup your Apple iPhone 6 Plus once again.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App"><a href="#Part-4-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Using-Find-My-iPhone-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Using Find My iPhone App"></a>Part 4: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Using Find My iPhone App</h2><p>There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus. This method is particularly useful if you’re traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/11/unlock-disabled-iphone-13-8.jpg"                      alt="find my on macos"                ></p><p>Step 2: Select your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus from the Apple iPhone 6 Plus devices from the left pane, click&#x2F; tap your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus and click&#x2F; tap Erase This Device</p><p>The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Without-A-Computer"><a href="#Part-5-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-Without-A-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Without A Computer"></a>Part 5: Unlock Disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus Without A Computer</h2><p>There are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus with no desktop&#x2F; laptop computer around? You have a few options.</p><p>You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus and return the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.</p><p>When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled Apple iPhone 6 Plus is using third-party tools such as Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, Dr.Fone is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. Dr.Fone is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.</p><p>Using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can not only unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched Dr.Fone, you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?</p><p>As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your Apple iPhone 6 Plus easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with Dr.Fone’s <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html" >iOS Phone Backup feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. Dr.Fone allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using Dr.Fone, now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again"><a href="#Part-6-Prevent-iPhone-From-Getting-Disabled-Again" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again"></a>Part 6: Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again</h2><p>After all this to get access back, you might think let’s go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don’t do that - that’s worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don’t accidentally disable your Apple iPhone 6 Plus again.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-About-Passcodes"><a href="#Tip-1-About-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: About Passcodes"></a>Tip 1: About Passcodes</h3><ul><li>1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.</li><li>1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.</li><li>1.3 Never use repeating numbers.</li><li>1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.</li></ul><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-Face-ID"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-Face-ID" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use Face ID"></a>Tip 2: Use Face ID</h3><p>Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-filming-for-tweet-sharing-content-without-retweeting/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Filming for Tweet  Sharing Content without Retweeting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-10-soothing-games-to-ease-anxiety/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top 10 Soothing Games to Ease Anxiety</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-choices-in-high-definition-screen-capture/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ultimate Choices in High Definition Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-metaverse-and-multiverse-demystified-an-in-depth-guide/"><u>[New] Metaverse and Multiverse Demystified  An In-Depth Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-premiere-live-concert-streams/"><u>[New] Premiere Live Concert Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-restore-your-viewing-experience-reclaim-the-icon-for-2024/"><u>[New] Restore Your Viewing Experience - Reclaim the Icon for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-snap-income-trends-in-making-money-on-social-media/"><u>[New] Snap Income  Trends in Making Money on Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-amplifying-your-brand-the-famebit-approach-to-youtube-affiliates-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Amplifying Your Brand  The FameBit Approach to YouTube Affiliates for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-envisioning-the-future-strategies-for-metaverse-brands/"><u>[Updated] Envisioning the Future  Strategies for Metaverse Brands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-building-a-broad-spectrum-audience-with-multichannel-strategy/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Building a Broad-Spectrum Audience with Multichannel Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-social-scanning-shorthand-efficient-profile-hunting-on-fb/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Social Scanning Shorthand  Efficient Profile Hunting on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-rated-apps-to-elevate-instagram-imagery/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top-Rated Apps to Elevate Instagram Imagery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-decoding-the-audience-who-viewed-your-insta-post/"><u>2024 Approved  Decoding the Audience  Who Viewed Your Insta Post?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-efficient-remote-video-transmission-unveiling-vlcs-potential/"><u>2024 Approved  Efficient Remote Video Transmission  Unveiling VLC's Potential</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-easy-solutions-to-hard-reset-nokia-g42-5g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Easy Solutions to Hard Reset Nokia G42 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/a-comprehensible-guide-to-adding-images-on-instagram/"><u>A Comprehensible Guide to Adding Images on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-6-plus-backup-password-never-set-but-still-asking-heres-the-fix-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple iPhone 6 Plus Backup Password Never Set But Still Asking?
