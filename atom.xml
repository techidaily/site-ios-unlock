These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel.

This Wondershare software application completely unlocks your phone, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p>This software is easy to use and incredibly simple, yet it gets the job done. If you’re looking for a quick way to get your iOS device back up and running with full access after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update, it doesn’t get much better than this. Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) software to either your Mac or Windows PC and open it, so you’re on the homepage. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the USB cable and wait for the software to recognize your device.</p><p>When it does, close iTunes if it automatically opens and clicks the Screen Unlock option from the main menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Unlock iOS Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will now need to put your device in DFU mode, also known as Recovery Mode. Fortunately, this is easy thanks to the on-screen instructions where you will hold down the volume down and power button for a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) has detected your device in DFU Mode. You’ll be able to select which device you’re using and what firmware you want to be repaired; in this case, iOS 17&#x2F;14.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once everything has been confirmed and you’re happy to continue, press the Unlock option.

Here’s how it works;</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re running the latest version of iTunes and then connect your iOS device to your Mac or Windows computer using the official USB cable. This should automatically open the iTunes window.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In iTunes, click the symbol representing your device and then click Summary. On this screen, you’ll be able to choose the Restore iPhone option at the top to begin the restoring process.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions where you’ll choose which backup file you want to use before iTunes, then restores your device. When the software has completed the process, you’ll be able to disconnect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and use it without a lock screen!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/restore_itunes_backup.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode"><a href="#2-4-Restore-in-recovery-mode" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Restore in recovery mode"></a>2.4 Restore in recovery mode</h3><p>In some cases, restoring your device using just iTunes will not be good enough, and it won’t have the effect you’re looking for; in this case, restoring your device with no lock screen after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.</p><p>If the above method of restoring your device via iTunes doesn’t work, or you haven’t got a backup file to load, you’ll need to restore your device using a move known as Recovery Mode, or DFU mode. This will hard reset your device and get it working to its full potential.</p><p>Here’s how to do it. (Note, the process will differ slightly depending on which model of iPhone you’re using).</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Press and hold the volume up button for about one second, and then switch and press the Volume Down button for the same amount of time. You can then hold the side button (on devices without a home button), and the following screen should appear after a few seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/itunes-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to your computer with iTunes and wait for iTunes to open. Make sure you’re running the latest version of iTunes before connecting up your device. Also, make sure you’re using the official USB cable for the most stability.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> iTunes should automatically detect that your device is in Recovery Mode and automatically restore your device to a default state without a lock screen. Wait until this process is completed before disconnecting your device and using it as normal.</p><h3 id="2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-5-Use-Find-My-iPhone-feature-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud"></a>2.5 Use Find My iPhone feature in iCloud</h3><p>The fifth and final approach you can take to removing a lock screen from your recently updated iPhone or iPad when faced with the iOS 17&#x2F;14 glitch is taking advantage of the integrated Apple technology and features are known as Find My iPhone.</p><p>While this feature originally allows you to literally find your Apple iPhone 12 Pro in the situation where it’s lost and offers many other security features to help ensure your device and data don’t fall into the wrong hands, you can also use it to remove your device unwanted lock screen.</p><p>Of course, this will only work if the Find My iPhone features have been enabled in the past, so make sure you’re using it to get it to work. Here’s how to use the feature to get your phone access back.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> From your computer, iPad, tablet, or mobile web browser, head over to iCloud.com and log into your iCloud account using the login in button at the top of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once signed in, scroll down the menu of features and select the Find iPhone feature. Click on the All Devices option at the top.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> From the list of devices connected to your account, click the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device name with the locked screen and then click the Erase option. This will clear everything from your device, much like the process we’ve spoken about in the methods above.</p><p>Leave the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to erase, and once completed, you’ll be able to pick up and use your phone as normal without a lock screen. You should also now be able to update to iOS 17&#x2F;14 without any problems!</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>And there you go, the five key ways you need to know when it comes to removing an unwanted lock screen from your iOS device after an iOS 17&#x2F;14 update.

If you set a password for a device before enabling the Lost Mode, you will need this password to unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro once it has returned to its proprietor.</p><p>The Lost Mode menu will ask you to set one if it has no password. Password is obligatory to stop Lost Mode once a device is returned to the owner, as Contact ID or Face ID won’t work for this reason.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-lost-mode-unlock-1.jpg"                      alt="lost mode"                ></p><p><strong>Send a Custom Text Message:</strong> When you sort out your lost iPhone and put it in Lost Mode, another supportive feature accessible to you is a custom message shown on the Lock Screen. You can enter any message to let an individual who found it realize this iPhone is lost. This way, you can demonstrate a phone number for the other person. That will expand opportunities to get your device back.</p><p><strong>Erase Data Remotely:</strong> Lost Mode allows you to delete the Apple iPhone 12 Pro if you believe it’s been some time since it’s gone and you don’t think you can get it back. Doing so will ensure nobody will use your user data.</p><p><strong>Track Your Device on Map:</strong> An owner can follow their lost iPhone on the map through the Lost Mode menu. The menu additionally gives email warnings to show the last location of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.</p><p><strong>Play Songs:</strong> Playing a sound might assist you with finding your lost iPhone if it’s still close by. The Apple iPhone 12 Pro will play a sound at top volume, no matter what volume level was set on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device when you lost it.</p><h3 id="1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode"><a href="#1-Remove-lost-mode-by-entering-the-correct-passcode" class="headerlink" title="1.

If your device was protected with a password before placing it in Lost Mode, enter it again.</p><p>If your device had no password while placing it in Lost Mode and you’ve entered it into iCloud while placing your Apple iPhone 12 Pro into Lost Mode, utilize this password. That will help you <strong>unlock lost iPhone</strong>, and you can start operating your Apple iPhone 12 Pro again.</p><h3 id="2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud"><a href="#2-Remove-it-from-Find-My-in-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.

Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Domain Name Service is an unsafe technique that utilizes a domain name to an IP address. iCloud stores every iPhone’s information, and when an iPhone is set up, it sends a request through DNS to ensure whether the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device has an activation lock enabled.</p><p>The DNS bypass will send a fake “device isn’t locked” message to iCloud through a server. It allows you to go through the setting of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and access some applications. However, you must remember that this technique works on iOS 11 or older versions.

In this case, we strongly suggest you use the Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock tool by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is a reliable tool and has been in the market for a long time. Professional unlock service providers use it because of its ease of use and clean interface.</p><p>So, without looking any further, download this tool for a remarkable unlocking experience. The methods below will guide you into unlocking your Apple iPhone 12 Pro within no time:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>Open the Dr.Fone software and tap the “Unlock iOS Screen.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="screen unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2. Boot iPhone in Recovery&#x2F;DFU mode</strong></p><p>Before bypassing the Apple iPhone 12 Pro lock screen, we want to boot it in Recovery or DFU mode by adhering to the on-screen guidelines. The Recovery mode is suggested for the iOS lock screen. However, if you can’t activate the Recovery mode, you can figure out how to activate the DFU mode from their official site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-3.png"                      alt="recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3. Affirm Device Information</strong></p><p>After getting the phone in DFU mode, Dr.Fone will show the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device information, for example, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro model and other data. You can choose the right information from the dropdown menu if the information isn’t right. Then, at that point, download the firmware for your Apple iPhone 12 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-4.png"                      alt="device information"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Unlock the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Screen Lock</strong></p><p>After downloading the required firmware effectively, click Unlock Now to remove the lock. However, note that this unlocking system will wipe the user data on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. Truly, there is no answer for <strong>iPhone Lost Mode unlock</strong> without losing your data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-9.png"                      alt="unlocked successfully"                ></p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>You might forget the password used before placing your Apple iPhone 12 Pro in Lost Mode.

Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.</p><p>While you can’t remove it, figuring out <strong>how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens</strong> is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device’s battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 8’s lock screen and make it work better for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?"></a>Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?</h2><p>You can’t remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 8 screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 8 device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 8. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 8 lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 8. Even if you’ve applied Part 1’s solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 8: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>. It’s usually located in the bottom left corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 8:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 8’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-8-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 8 Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 8 Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 8 flashlight.

How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?</h2><p>iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple’s security doesn’t allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is restricted and doesn’t support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is locked or not:</p><h3 id="Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings"><a href="#Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings"></a>Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings</h3><p>To check whether your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, open your Apple iPhone SE (2020) “Settings” and tap the “General” option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="check carrier lock from settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After that, choose the “Carrier Lock” option to see the restrictions. If your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is unlocked, it will not show any SIM restriction. If you see the “SIM Locked” restriction, your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is locked.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="iphone is carrier locked"                ></p><h3 id="Check-iPhone-Got-Disabled-Issue"><a href="#Check-iPhone-Got-Disabled-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue"></a>Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue</h3><p>The “iPhone is Disabled” issue appears when you or anyone else enters the wrong passcode multiple times. In that case, Apple’s security restricts you from entering the passcode for a specific time interval. After a while, it might permanently disable your Apple iPhone SE (2020) from being accessed through a passcode or any other direct security unlocking option. However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="iphone is disabled issue"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-It-Cost-To-Unlock-iPhone-Carrier-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-It-Cost-To-Unlock-iPhone-Carrier-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

However, it’s important to take steps to ensure that your iOS data remains safe during the process. Here are some tips to help you do just that:</p><ul><li><strong>Backup Your Files</strong></li></ul><p>Before you <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong>, create a <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup/backup-iphone-with-broken-screen.html"><u>backup of your data</u></a> so you don’t lose important files. You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.</p><p>Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you’re getting back exactly what you want. This way, you can restore your data to your new Apple ID if needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Password Check</strong></li></ul><p>Review your current passwords. Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid Sharing an Apple ID</strong></li></ul><p>It’s best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></li></ul><p>If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security. It’s simple and highly effective.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Changing your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other iOS devices is a simple process that can help you protect your privacy and information. With the tips above, you can ensure your iOS data is safe and secure during the switch.</p><p>And if you need to remove your Apple ID without a password, Dr.Fone is a good option.

But <strong>what does jailbreaking an iPhone do</strong>? Jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11 removes the restrictions imposed by Apple on its operating system, iOS. It offers more customization options and access to extra apps.</p><p>However, is jailbreaking an iPhone safe and legal? It’s a complex answer and not a decision to take lightly. While the process is legal in most countries, its applications can cross legal lines, like installing pirated apps.</p><p>To learn more, read on and explore the capabilities of a jailbroken iPhone in the following sections. This article will also touch on its impact on <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-iphone-11-12-icloud-activation-lock.html"><u>iCloud Activation Lock</u></a>. Let’s start with the benefits and risks of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone devices back view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Jailbreaking-an-iPhone-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?"></a>Part 1: What Does Jailbreaking an iPhone Do?</h2><p>Before trying to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 11, it’s crucial to understand, “<strong>What can you do with a jailbroken iPhone</strong>?” While it opens up exciting possibilities, it also introduces potential drawbacks. In this section, you’ll learn both aspects.</p><p>Benefits of Jailbreaking</p><p>Apple’s App Store and iOS offer a curated selection of features and functionalities. But for some users, this can feel restrictive. Here are some advantages of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11:</p><ul><li><strong>Install Unapproved Apps</strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s App Store has strict guidelines limiting the type of apps available. Jailbreaking offers various third-party apps and tweaks not available on the App Store. These could include emulators, screen recorders, or apps that bypass certain limitations.</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Customization Options</strong></li></ul><p>Users can customize their iPhones beyond the limitations imposed by Apple after Jailbreaking. It includes changing themes, icons, and even the look and feel of the user interface. This level of personalization can enhance your experience while using your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-02.jpg"                      alt="circleapps launcher tweak for jailbroken iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking System-wide Features</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking unlocks extra iPhone features. It lets you access advanced settings and functions. These aren’t in the regular, non-jailbroken mode. More control means more customization. You can optimize your Apple iPhone 11 based on your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Unlocking Network Restrictions</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking frees the Apple iPhone 11 from carrier restrictions. You can then use it with different network providers. This is handy for travelers or those wanting better service options.</p><p>However, these benefits come with caveats you should consider.</p><p>Risks of Jailbreaking</p><p>While jailbreaking itself isn’t illegal, it does involve bypassing Apple’s security measures. This increased freedom comes with its own set of potential pitfalls. Here are some potential downsides of jailbreaking your Apple iPhone 11:</p><ul><li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></li></ul><p>Bypassing Apple’s security measures can expose your device to vulnerabilities. Malicious apps or tweaks can exploit these vulnerabilities, risking your data and privacy. It could lead to the theft of your data, including passwords, financial information, and photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Voided Warranty</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking is seen by Apple as a device modification. Doing so can void your device warranty. So, if jailbreaking causes any issues, Apple won’t cover them under their support services—both hardware and software.</p><ul><li><strong>Instability and Performance Issues</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may make your system unstable and cause performance problems. When you add unauthorized tweaks or apps, they can clash with iOS. This clash might result in <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-apps-crashing-on-ios-13.html"><u>crashes</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/fix-samsung-freeze.html"><u>freezes</u></a>, or a general drop in your Apple iPhone 11’s performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-does-jailbreaking-an-iphone-do-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone apps crashing message"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Difficulty in Updating</strong></li></ul><p>Jailbreaking may cause problems with new iOS updates. When Apple releases updates, jailbreak developers might take time to catch up. This delay can leave you without access to the latest features and security patches.</p><ul><li><strong>Bricking Risk</strong></li></ul><p>Incorrect jailbreaking can “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/how-to-fix-bricked-iphone.html"><u>brick</u></a>“ your Apple iPhone 11, making it unusable. This risk goes up if you try it without enough knowledge or with unreliable tools.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-Jailbreak-iPhone-Do-to-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: What Can Jailbreak iPhone Do to iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>Jailbreaking an iPhone won’t remove the iCloud Activation Lock, contrary to a common misconception. While jailbreaking provides extensive control over your device’s system, it is not synonymous with bypassing iCloud Activation Lock. These are distinct concepts.

It could be due to a forgotten passcode, a second-hand purchase with an activation lock, or any other reason. Facing the “iPhone Locked to Owner” scenario can be hard as the fault doesn’t lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device will remain locked to the previous owner’s iCloud account. Apple provides guidelines and procedures for sellers to remove Activation Lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner-Security"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-Methods-To-Remove-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner-Security" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner Security"></a>Part 2: 5 Best Methods To Remove the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner Security</h2><p>Having an iPhone locked to its previous owner’s security can be frustrating. That’s why finding effective methods to remove the lock is crucial. Luckily, various methods exist to <strong><strong>bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max locked to the owner for free</strong></strong>. Given below are the top 5 methods to resolve this issue:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device"><a href="#Method-1-Use-the-Old-iOS-Passcode-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device"></a>Method 1: Use the Old iOS Passcode To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device</h3><p>If you’ve recently obtained a used iPhone, there is a possibility that the old iOS passcode might still be effective. When an iPhone is locked to its owner, you will find an option to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device using the passcode. It presents another viable option to remove the lock.</p><p>To proceed, you will need to contact the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and request the passcode. Use the following guide after getting the old passcode of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><p><strong><strong>Step:</strong></strong> Access your locked iPhone and tap “Unlock with Passcode.” On the following screen, enter the old passcode to remove the Activation Lock.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-2.jpg"                      alt="tap unlock with passcode"                ></p></li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device-Using-iCloud"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-Owner-To-Erase-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-device-Using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device Using iCloud"></a>Method 2: Ask the Owner To Erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device Using iCloud</h3><p>The passcode is not the only thing you can ask from the previous owner of the iPhone. You can also ask the previous owner to erase your device remotely. It can be helpful if the previous owner doesn’t remember the passcode or you are unable to meet them in person.</p><p>To make this procedure work, the owner will need to use the Find My Device feature from the iCloud website. Here is what the owner needs to do to resolve Activation Lock from your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 1:</strong></strong> Access the iCloud website on your computer’s browser and log in using Apple ID. Afterward, click the “Find My” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-3.jpg"                      alt="select find my feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Step 2:</strong></strong> On the following screen, select your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from “All Devices.” Now choose “Erase iPhone” from the available options to erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and remove the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on erase iphone"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner"><a href="#Method-3-Use-the-DNS-Method-To-Unlock-the-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Locked-to-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner"></a>Method 3: Use the DNS Method To Unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Locked to Owner</h3><p>When you are unable to access the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, the DNS method can be an alternative solution. This method involves changing the DNS settings on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to bypass the activation lock screen. However, the procedure works only for devices running on older iOS versions.</p><p>The reason is that the process uses a loophole to allow you access to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device.

Here is how to do that:</p><p>Step 1: If you have any other Apple device that is logged in with the same Apple ID as the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you can launch Find My on that device. Else, you can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/" >https://icloud.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log into the same iCloud account&#x2F; Apple ID as the locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>Step 2: Under Find My (or Find My iPhone if you are using the iCloud website), select your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and click Erase iPhone and confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/09/unlock-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="find my iphone"                ></p><p>That’s it.

How To Check Whether iPhone Is Locked or Not?</h2><p>iOS devices get disabled when you enter a wrong passcode multiple times because Apple’s security doesn’t allow unauthorized access. Also, you can face carrier-locked issues when your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is restricted and doesn’t support other SIM services. These are common issues that iPhone users often come across. Well, this section provides a simple way to check whether your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is locked or not:</p><h3 id="Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings"><a href="#Confirm-Carrier-Locked-iPhone-From-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings"></a>Confirm Carrier Locked iPhone From Settings</h3><p>To check whether your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is carrier-locked or unlocked from settings, follow the given steps one-by-one.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, open your Apple iPhone 14 Pro “Settings” and tap the “General” option. Move into the “About” section to locate the carrier lock option from the list.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="check carrier lock from settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After that, choose the “Carrier Lock” option to see the restrictions. If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is unlocked, it will not show any SIM restriction. If you see the “SIM Locked” restriction, your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is locked.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="iphone is carrier locked"                ></p><h3 id="Check-iPhone-Got-Disabled-Issue"><a href="#Check-iPhone-Got-Disabled-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue"></a>Check iPhone Got Disabled Issue</h3><p>The “iPhone is Disabled” issue appears when you or anyone else enters the wrong passcode multiple times. In that case, Apple’s security restricts you from entering the passcode for a specific time interval. After a while, it might permanently disable your Apple iPhone 14 Pro from being accessed through a passcode or any other direct security unlocking option. However, there is no shortcut to bypassing this issue unless you use a legitimate tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/how-much-will-it-cost-to-unlock-an-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="iphone is disabled issue"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-It-Cost-To-Unlock-iPhone-Carrier-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-It-Cost-To-Unlock-iPhone-Carrier-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Today, life is not the same as it used to be. Communication and traveling became so easy. People can fly and within few hours reach the destination.

Something that can fit in a pocket, and a human can carry it anywhere without feeling its weight. A small device, the mobile phone has great competition in the market. Android phones are coming up with brilliant features to stand equally with iPhones, but iOS has its own customers and a powerful market value.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Lock-Screen"><a href="#How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="How To Remove Flashlight From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Lock Screen"></a>How To Remove Flashlight From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Lock Screen</h2><p>Ever wonder why the flashlight shows up on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro lock screen? Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.</p><p>While you can’t remove it, figuring out <strong>how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens</strong> is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device’s battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 11 Pro’s lock screen and make it work better for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?"></a>Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?</h2><p>You can’t remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 11 Pro screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back.

Facing the “iPhone Locked to Owner” scenario can be hard as the fault doesn’t lie with you. Regardless of the fact, finding a solution to unlock an “<strong><strong>iPhone Locked to Owner</strong></strong>“ can be a daunting task.</p><p>We bring you a comprehensive guide that explores the best methods to unlock an “iPhone Locked to Owner.” This article provides a detailed guide covering official and unofficial methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-A-Brief-Overview-of-the-Functionality-of-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: A Brief Overview of the Functionality of Activation Lock</h2><p>Activation Lock is a strong and innovative security feature introduced by Apple. This lock is available on Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of a device in case it is lost, stolen, or misplaced. Here’s a brief overview of the features of Activation Lock:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/iphone-locked-to-owner-1.jpg"                      alt="iphone to owner error"                ></p><h3 id="Device-Association"><a href="#Device-Association" class="headerlink" title="Device Association"></a>Device Association</h3><p>The Activation Lock works by associating a device with the iCloud account of the owner. When the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device is set up or restored, it prompts the user to sign in with their Apple ID and activates Activation Lock.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-Status"><a href="#Activation-Lock-Status" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock Status"></a>Activation Lock Status</h3><p>Once enabled, Activation Lock securely stores the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s unique identifier (IMEI or serial number). It also stores the associated iCloud account details on Apple’s servers. This information is used to verify the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s status during activation and prevent unauthorized use.</p><h3 id="Locking-Mechanism"><a href="#Locking-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="Locking Mechanism"></a>Locking Mechanism</h3><p>If a device with Activation Lock is lost or stolen, the owner can activate Lost Mode using the Find My app or iCloud website. Lost Mode remotely locks the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, preventing anyone from accessing the user’s data. It also prevents device use without the owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Device-Recovery"><a href="#Device-Recovery" class="headerlink" title="Device Recovery"></a>Device Recovery</h3><p>In Lost Mode, the owner can provide contact information and display a custom message on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s screen. These can help in facilitating its return. The device remains locked until the owner either unlocks it through iCloud or erases its data remotely.</p><h3 id="iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass"><a href="#iCloud-Activation-Lock-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Activation Lock Bypass"></a>iCloud Activation Lock Bypass</h3><p>With Activation Lock, you get an added layer of security. This makes it challenging for unauthorized individuals to use a locked device. Apple’s servers confirm the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s activation status before allowing access to the OS. Thus, bypassing Activation Lock requires the original owner’s Apple ID and password.</p><h3 id="Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices"><a href="#Activation-Lock-on-Used-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Activation Lock on Used Devices"></a>Activation Lock on Used Devices</h3><p>When purchasing a used Apple device, you should ensure that Activation Lock is disabled. Otherwise, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device will remain locked to the previous owner’s iCloud account.

Here is how you can set up switch control to <strong>iPhone swipe to unlock</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s Settings, then tap on “Accessibility.” Now find and select “Switch Control,” and within it, navigate to “Switches.” Now, tap “Add New Switch” and choose “Camera.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/unlock-phone-without-swiping-up-8.jpg"                      alt="add a new switch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972698/19272" target="_top" id="1972698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Set Left Head Movement and Right Head Movement separately to “Home.” This action will lock the screen when tilting your head left or right.

Here’s how you can do it:</p><p><strong>Option 1: Contact the Original Owner</strong></p><p>One way to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is by contacting the person who originally owned it. Talking to the previous owner can be a game-changer if your Apple iPhone 12 Pro ended up on the blacklist because it was reported as lost or stolen. They can help you sort things out with the carrier and get the blacklist status lifted.</p><p><strong>Option 2: Contact Your Carrier</strong></p><p>Your next option is to contact your carrier for an <strong>iPhone blacklist removal service</strong>. The company provides your phone service, so they have the authority to remove the blacklist status from your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. Be prepared to explain your situation; they will guide you through the process. That means you can get in touch with AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile.</p><p>If your carrier blacklisted the phone in error, you can request it be removed from the list for free. You must repay the bill if the carrier blacklisted the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device due to past-due account payments. Unfortunately, the carrier cannot remove or unlock the phone if the previous owner blacklisted the smartphone by reporting it as lost or stolen.</p><p>Both of these methods are free and can work like a charm. However, they might take some time and effort on your part. But if you’re patient and persistent, you could end up with a fully functional iPhone again. Remember, staying polite and patient when dealing with the original owner or the carrier is critical.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted"><a href="#Part-3-Preventive-Measures-To-Avoid-Getting-an-iPhone-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted"></a>Part 3: Preventive Measures To Avoid Getting an iPhone Blacklisted</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/iphone-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-iemi.html" >rescue a blacklisted iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> let’s talk about how to keep it out of trouble in the first place.

It utilizes an exceptional chip to filter the face with many spots. It makes a 3D contour of the look that works in low, glorious light around evening time, and your eyes must be opened. The opportunity to randomly unlock an iPhone with FaceID is 1&#x2F;1 million, compared to 1&#x2F;50000 with Touch ID.</p><p>It doesn’t work by snapping a picture of your face, but by taking a contour of your face if you utilize a camera that can see infrared. However, a photograph is a level and cannot give a dab matrix required for Face ID to work. You may be holding a clear piece of paper before the phone.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>That’s all about our take on <strong>how to unlock iPhone without passcode or face ID 2022.</strong> We have worked hard to make sure you get the right solutions in hand.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Lock-Screen"><a href="#How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="How To Remove Flashlight From Apple iPhone 12 Pro Lock Screen"></a>How To Remove Flashlight From Apple iPhone 12 Pro Lock Screen</h2><p>Ever wonder why the flashlight shows up on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro lock screen? Especially when it happens in your pocket or while you’re holding it. If you, like many, accidentally turn it on and drain your battery, no need to worry.</p><p>While you can’t remove it, figuring out <strong>how to remove flashlight from iPhone lock screens</strong> is a common question. This guide shares several ways to prevent accidental activations and save your device’s battery. Keep reading for easy solutions to take charge of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s lock screen and make it work better for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Remove-Flashlight-From-iPhone-Lock-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?"></a>Part 1: How To Remove Flashlight From iPhone Lock Screens?</h2><p>You can’t remove the shortcuts like the flashlight icon from an iPhone lock screen. These are built-in features, and Apple doesn’t currently offer an option to disable them. However, there are some workarounds to make the flashlights less accessible and avoid turning them on accidentally. You can turn off Tap to Wake, Raise to Wake, remove the flashlight icon from the control center, and turn off the Back Tap shortcut.</p><p>Find out the steps below.</p><p>Quick Fix No. 1: Turn Off Tap To Wake</p><p>Tap to Wake lets you light up your Apple iPhone 12 Pro screen with a simple tap. It’s handy, but there’s a catch – tapping near the bottom right corner might accidentally turn on the flashlight icon. The Tap to Wake feature can be troublesome, especially in the dark, when you don’t want any unexpected brightness.</p><p>Turning off the Tap to Wake feature is not directly related to the issue of iPhone users wanting to <strong>remove the flashlight from lock screens</strong>. However, adjusting settings like Tap to Wake can be part of customizing the overall user experience on an iPhone. When turned off, the screen won’t light up with a tap, reducing the likelihood of accidentally triggering the flashlight.</p><p>Here is how to turn off the Tap to Wake feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> or <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off <strong>Tap to Wake</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off tap to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 2: Turn Off Raise To Wake</p><p>With “Raise to Wake” enabled, simply picking up your phone can activate the lock screen. Consequently, the flashlight icon becomes more susceptible to accidental touches. To address this, turning off this feature stops the screen from waking when you lift your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. By doing so, it becomes less likely that you’ll accidentally turn on the flashlight when you pick up your iOS device.</p><p>Here is <strong>how to remove flashlights from iPhone lock screens</strong> when not needed:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong> on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toggle off the <strong>Raise to Wake</strong> option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone turn off raise to wake"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 3: Remove the Flashlight From the Control Center</p><p>The Control Center on iPhones is a quick-access panel. You can access it by swiping down from the top right corner of your screen. There, you can control various settings, like the flashlight. If you remove it, the flashlight becomes less accessible from the lock screen. Follow these steps to remove the flashlight from the control center:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on <strong>Customize Controls</strong>, then find the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the red minus (<strong>-</strong>) sign next to the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap <strong>Remove</strong> to confirm deleting the <strong>Flashlight</strong> icon from the <strong>Control Center</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-04.jpg"                      alt="remove flashlight from iphone control center"                ></p><p>Quick Fix No. 4: Turn Off Back Tap Shortcut</p><p>Back Tap on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro lets you set actions for double or triple taps on the back. One of these actions is turning on the flashlight. If you often tap your phone’s back, you might accidentally activate the flashlight. Turning off the Back Tap for the flashlight prevents these accidental activations.</p><p>Although the flashlight icon remains on the lock screen, you won’t accidentally turn it on by hitting the back of your phone. Here’s how to disable the Back Tap for the flashlight shortcut:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Touch</strong> &gt; <strong>Back Tap</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the <strong>Double Tap</strong> or <strong>Triple Tap</strong> option you’re using for the flashlight shortcut.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose <strong>None</strong> instead of the currently assigned action, which might be <strong><strong>Flashlight</strong></strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-05.jpg"                      alt="setup iphone back tap to none"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Turn-Off-the-Flashlight-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How To Turn Off the Flashlight on iPhone?</h2><p>Now, let’s address turning off the flashlight on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. Even if you’ve applied Part 1’s solutions, knowing how to switch off the flashlight is crucial. In this section, you’ll learn <strong>how to turn the light off on iPhone</strong> devices.</p><p>Method No. 1: Turn Off the Flashlight in the Control Center</p><p>You can’t remove the flashlight icon from the lock screen, but you can still turn it off easily. Just swipe down from the upper-right corner or swipe up from the bottom (for iPhones with a Home button). Then, follow these steps to discover <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro: Here’s how to do it.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Find the flashlight icon in the <strong>Control Center</strong>. It’s usually located in the bottom left corner.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the flashlight icon once to turn it off. The icon will turn gray, indicating the flashlight is deactivated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-06.jpg"                      alt="turn off flashlight from control center"                ></p><p>This method is fast and convenient, especially if you’ve kept the flashlight icon in the Control Center. Plus, it works regardless of how the flashlight was activated, even if it was an accidental tap on the lock screen.</p><p>Method No. 2: Use Siri To Turn Off Flashlight</p><p>To go hands-free and avoid accidental taps, you can use Siri to turn off the flashlight. For those who favor a hands-free approach, it offers an alternative method, particularly if you haven’t customized the Control Center. Here’s <strong>how to turn off the flashlight</strong> with Siri on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Say <strong>“Hey Siri”</strong> or press and hold the power button (or Home button on older iPhones) to activate Siri.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Give the commands saying, <strong>“Turn off the flashlight.”</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Siri will confirm your request and turn off the flashlight. You’ll hear a voice cue and see the flashlight icon on your screen dim.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-flashlight-from-lock-screen-07.jpg"                      alt="use siri to turn off flashlight"                ></p><p>Remember, even with Siri, ensure your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s microphone isn’t covered or blocked for successful voice recognition.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Bonus-Part-Easily-Unlock-Your-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Without a Password"></a>Bonus Part: Easily Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Without a Password</h2><p>Removing the flashlight shortcut avoids accidentally activating the Apple iPhone 12 Pro flashlight.

For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven’t done that, this method won’t work. Here’s how you can use iTunes to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-4.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 12 without passcode with itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once recognized, your Apple iPhone 12 Pro will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the ‘Summary’ option present in the left sidebar.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, click on the ‘Restore iPhone’ button in the right sidebar.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed.

This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here’s how you can use recovery mode to unlock your Apple iPhone 12 Pro:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-unlock-iphone-11-12-13-without-passcode-5.jpg"                      alt="how to unlock iphone 11 without password in recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the computer and launch the iTunes application.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press and hold down the ‘Volume’ and ‘Power’ buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the ‘OK’ button.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, click on the ‘Restore iPhone’ button in the Summary tab.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed.

That includes your contact list, email, financial information, and social media passwords. All this data is valuable - others can use it to do identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.</p><p>If you feel the existing Apple ID isn’t secure enough, it’s a good idea to <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> or other devices. Aside from this, there are a few scenarios where you might find yourself needing to change your details:</p><p>You No Longer Use the Email Address or Phone Number Associated With Your Apple ID</p><p>Life moves fast, and sometimes contact info changes. If the email or phone number linked to your Apple ID becomes outdated, it’s a good idea to update it. That way, you won’t miss out on vital notifications or have trouble recovering your account if needed.</p><p>You Want To Simplify Your Online Life</p><p>If you have multiple email addresses, you may want to consolidate them into one email address. It can make it easier to manage and remember your online accounts, including your Apple ID.</p><p>You Are Relocating to a Different Region or Country</p><p>Moving abroad? Your Apple ID may need an update to match your new location. It ensures access to region-specific apps and services. You need to have a few things in place before you can do that: add a payment method for your new location, cancel your subscriptions, and spend your store credit. Aside from that, you will also need to change your Apple ID country or region.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-02.jpg"                      alt="apple id account information"                ></p><p>Changing your Apple ID can be smart, ensuring your digital life stays up-to-date, secure, and tailored to your needs.

You can update your Apple ID account anytime without disrupting your data. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to change your Apple ID</strong> email address. Just sign out of all Apple services and devices that use your account first.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/"><u>Apple ID</u></a> official website and log in to your account credentials.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-03.jpg"                      alt="apple id website interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once logged in, select <strong>Apple ID</strong> in the <strong>Sign-In and Security</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-04.jpg"                      alt="apple id sign in and security"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the <strong>Apple ID</strong> pop-up window, enter your new Apple ID in the <strong>Change your Apple ID</strong> text field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-05.jpg"                      alt="enter a new apple id interface"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select <strong>Change Apple ID</strong> to proceed.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check your email to get a verification code sent by Apple to ensure that only you can change it to a third-party email address.

It’s possible, but it depends on your location, how you created your account, and what version of iOS you’re using.</p><p>If you’re in China mainland or India, and you’re using iOS 11 or later, you can create a new Apple ID with Your Apple iPhone 12 number as the username. However, Your Apple iPhone 12 number must be (+86) or (+91). So, if you’re thinking of, “<strong>How can I change my Apple ID on my iPad</strong> if it’s a mobile phone number?” then this guide is for you:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log out of all Apple services and devices currently signed in with your Apple ID, except the one you’re using to change your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On your iPad, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>[your account name]</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign-in &amp; Security</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap <strong>Edit</strong> next to <strong>Email &amp; Phone Numbers</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-06.jpg"                      alt="click edit on iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to the <strong>Delete</strong> icon next to your mobile number and follow the directions given.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Enter the code sent to the mobile number you added as your new Apple ID to verify it.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Log into all Apple services using your new Apple ID.</li></ul><p>Even if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to a mobile phone number, you can still associate it with a phone number on your account page.

However, there can be setbacks during the process. Now, here’s what to do if you find yourself unable to do it and why it might be happening:</p><p>Try Again Later</p><p>If you encounter errors during the process, give it a little time and try again. Mayne it is because you <strong>changed your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> to an iCloud email address within 30 days.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/how-to-change-apple-id-on-ipad-07.jpg"                      alt="change apple id to icloud email"                ></p><p>Check if Apple ID Is Already in Use</p><p>Apple IDs are unique, and you can’t have two identical ones. If you’re trying to change your Apple ID to one that’s already in use, you’ll hit a roadblock. Ensure that the new Apple ID you want isn’t already taken. Remove it from the family member’s account if they are using it.</p><p>Your Apple ID Is an Email Address</p><p>If your current Apple ID is an email address, you won’t be able to change it to a mobile phone number directly. Instead, you can add an email or phone number to your account for contact purposes.</p><p>If you’ve addressed these issues and still can’t change your Apple ID, don’t worry. Apple customer support is available to assist you with account-related challenges. Contact them for guidance and solutions tailored to your situation.</p><p>However, if you can’t <strong>change your Apple ID on your iPad</strong> because you forgot or don’t have access to the password, you can use a third-party tool such as Dr.Fone. This tool is easy to use and can help you unlock your iPad and remove the Apple ID in a few clicks.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-4-Using-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Using Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Part 4: Using <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></h2><p>Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) tool is your go-to solution for unlocking iOS devices without a passcode.

You can create a backup using iCloud or Dr.Fone.</p><p>Dr.Fone also allows you to view the contents of your backup before you restore it, so you can ensure that you’re getting back exactly what you want.

Change any weak or compromised ones, including your Apple ID password, and never share it with anyone.</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid Sharing an Apple ID</strong></li></ul><p>It’s best practice for each family member to have their own Apple ID. Sharing one can lead to problems with app purchases, data syncing, and privacy.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></li></ul><p>If not already enabled, turn on 2FA for an extra layer of security.

If you don’t want to jailbreak your device, then you can simply take the assistance of the above-mentioned solutions.</p><p>However, if you have a jailbroken device and would like to app lock the iPhone, then you can also use AppLocker. It is available at Cydia’s repository and can be purchased for just $0.99. It can be installed on your jailbroken device to get an added level of security. Not just apps, it can also be used to lock certain settings, folders, accessibilities, and more. To learn how to lock apps on iPhone using AppLocker, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, get AppLocker on your device from <a class="link"   href="http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker" >http://www.cydiasources.net/applocker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. As of now, it works on iOS 6 to 10 versions.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> After installing the tweak, you can go to Settings &gt; Applocker to access it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136509845.jpg"                      alt="iphone applocker"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> To access the feature, make sure that you have “<strong>Enabled</strong>” it (by turning it on).</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This will let you set up a passcode to lock the apps and settings of your choice.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> To app lock, the iPhone, visit the “<strong>Application Locking</strong>” feature on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15060136826933.jpg"                      alt="application locking"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> From here, you can turn on (or off) the locking feature for apps of your choice.</p><p>This will let your app lock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro without any trouble.

Wait for a while as it will reset your Apple iPhone 13 mini remotely.</p><p>As you can see, the Find my iPhone service was majorly introduced to discover the location of a lost iOS device. Though, you can use it to ring your device or erase it remotely as well. In this way, you can learn how to unlock iPhone 5 passcode without computer. The technique can also be implemented in other iPhone versions like Apple iPhone 13 mini, 6 Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and more.</p><p>Attention: All your data will be erased while you are unlocking with this tool.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Unlock iPhone&#x2F;iPad Lock Screen Without Hassle.</p><ul><li>Intuitive instructions to unlock iPhone without the passcode.</li><li>Removes the iPhone’s lock screen whenever it is disabled.</li><li>Works for all models of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.</li><li>Fully compatible with the latest iOS 11.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/new_23.png"                      alt="New icon"                ></li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SG-KuuduzaY"></iframe><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130531/26400" target="_top" id="2130531">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130531" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130531/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-passcode-without-computer-using-Siri-bug"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-passcode-without-computer-using-Siri-bug" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 13 mini passcode without computer using Siri bug?"></a>Part 2: How to unlock Apple iPhone 13 mini passcode without computer using Siri bug?</h2><p>This might surprise you, but there is a loophole in Siri that can be exploited to unlock the Apple iPhone 13 mini device.
